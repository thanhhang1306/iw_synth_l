"In 1744, Burke started at Trinity College Dublin, a Protestant establishment, which up until 1793, did not permit Catholics to take degrees. In 1747, he set up a debating society, ""Edmund Burke's Club"", which, in 1770, merged with TCD's Historical Club to form the College Historical Society; it is the oldest undergraduate society in the world. The minutes of the meetings of Burke's Club remain in the collection of the Historical Society. Burke graduated from Trinity in 1748. Burke's father wanted him to read Law, and with this in mind he went to London in 1750, where he entered the Middle Temple, before soon giving up legal study to travel in Continental Europe.

"As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.",7,How many news media outlets does Notre Dame run?,Saint Mary's College,nine,Notre Dame's,Notre Dame,2,"ከም ኣብ ብጥዕሚ ካልእ ,universities Notre 'Dame's students ጉየ ሓደ ቑጽሪ ካብ ዜና media .outlets እቲ ትሸዓተ -student-run outlets ይሓውስ ሰለስተ ,newspapers ክልቲኡ ሓደ radio እና television ,ጣብያ እና ቡዙሓት magazines እና .journals Begun ከም ሓደ -one-page journal አብ ውሽጢ መስከረም ,1876 እቲ Scholastic ጋዜጣ እዩ issued ኽልተ ግዜ monthly እና claims ናብ ኩን እቲ oldest continuous collegiate publication አብ ውሽጢ እቲ United .States እቲ ካልእ ,ጋዜጣ እቲ ,Juggler እዩ ተለቒቑ ኽልተ ግዜ ሓደ ዓመት እና focuses አብ ልዕሊ ተምሃራይ ስነ ጽሑፍ እና .artwork እቲ Dome yearbook እዩ published .annually እቲ newspapers ኣለኒ varying publication ,interests ምስ እቲ Observer published መዓልታዊ እና mainly reporting ዩኒቨርሲቲ እና ካልእ ,ዜና እና staffed ብ students ካብ ክልቲኡ Notre Dame እና Saint 'Mary's .ኮሌጅ Unlike Scholastic እና እቲ ,Dome እቲ Observer እዩ ሓደ ዓርሱ ዝኸኣለ publication እና ምግባር ዘይኮነ ኣለኒ ሓደ faculty advisor ወይ ዝኾነ editorial oversight ካብ እቲ .ዩኒቨርሲቲ አብ ውሽጢ ,1987 መዓዝ ንእሽተይ students believed እቲ እቲ Observer ጀሚሩ ናብ አርኢ ሓደ ዓቃቢ ,ኣድልዎ ሓደ liberal ,newspaper ልሙድ ትርጉም ኔሩ .published ,ከምኡውን አብ ውሽጢ ,2003 መዓዝ ካልእ students believed እቲ እቲ ወረቐት showed ሓደ liberal ,ኣድልዎ እቲ ዓቃቢ ወረቐት Irish Rover ኬዱ ናብ ውሽጢ .ምህርቲ ዋላ ወረቐት እዩ published ከም ኩል ግዘ ከም እቲ ;Observer ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ኩሎም ሰለስተ እዮም distributed ናብ ኩሎም .students ,ኣብ መወዳእታ አብ ውሽጢ ፅድያ 2008 ሓደ undergraduate journal ን political ሳይንስ ,ፅንዓት ብልዕሊ ,Politics ዝተሰርሐ ናቱ .debut",ከመይ ቡዙሕ ዜና media outlets ምግባር Notre Dame ?ጉየ,Saint 'Mary's ኮሌጅ,ትሸዓተ,Notre 'Dame's,Notre Dame
"Similar developments have taken place in other alphabets. The lower-case script for the Greek alphabet has its origins in the 7th century and acquired its quadrilinear form in the 8th century. Over time, uncial letter forms were increasingly mixed into the script.

"The rule of law is the legal principle that law should govern a nation, as opposed to being governed by arbitrary decisions of individual government officials. It primarily refers to the influence and authority of law within society, particularly as a constraint upon behaviour, including behaviour of government officials. The phrase can be traced back to 16th century Britain, and in the following century the Scottish theologian Samuel Rutherford used the phrase in his argument against the divine right of kings. The rule of law was further popularized in the 19th century by British jurist A. V. Dicey.

"In monotheism and henotheism, God is conceived of as the Supreme Being and principal object of faith. The concept of God as described by theologians commonly includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), omnibenevolence (perfect goodness), divine simplicity, and eternal and necessary existence. God is also usually defined as a non-corporeal being without any human biological gender, but the concept of God actively (as opposed to receptively) creating the universe has caused some religions to give ""Him"" the metaphorical name of ""Father"". Because God is conceived as not being a corporeal being, God cannot(some say should not) be portrayed in a literal visual image; some religious groups use a man (sometimes old and bearded) to symbolize God because of His deed of creating man's mind in the image of His own.",14,What is God conceived of as?,—,—,—,the Supreme Being,4,"አብ ውሽጢ monotheism እና ,henotheism ፈጣሪ እዩ conceived ካብ ከም እቲ Supreme ፍጥረት እና ርእሰ መምህር ግኡዝ ነገር ካብ .እምነት እቲ ጭብጢ ካብ ፈጣሪ ከም described ብ theologians commonly includes እቲ attributes ካብ omniscience (infinite ),ፍልጠት omnipotence (unlimited ),ሓይሊ omnipresence (እዋናዊ ),everywhere omnibenevolence (ፍፁም ),goodness መለኮታዊ ,simplicity እና ቀፃሊ እና አድላዩ .ህላወ ፈጣሪ እዩ እውን ብልሙድ defined ከም ሓደ -non-corporeal ፍጥረት ብዘይካ ዝኾነ ሰብ biological ,ፆታ ግን እቲ ጭብጢ ካብ ፈጣሪ actively (ከም opposed ናብ )receptively creating እቲ universe ኣለዎ caused ንእሽተይ religions ናብ ሃብ """"ንሱ እቲ metaphorical ሽም ካብ """".ኣቦ ምኽንያቱ ፈጣሪ እዩ conceived ከም ዘይኮነ ፍጥረት ሓደ corporeal ,ፍጥረት ፈጣሪ (cannot(some በል ይሓይሽ )ዘይኮነ ኩን portrayed አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ literal ምስላዊ ;ስእሊ ንእሽተይ ሃይማኖታዊ groups ጥቅሚ ሓደ ሰብኣይ (ሓደ ሓደ ግዘ ዓብይ እና )bearded ናብ symbolize ፈጣሪ ምኽንያቱ ካብ ናቱ ሓቂ ካብ creating 'man's ሓንጎል አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ስእሊ ካብ ናቱ .ወንን",እንታይ እዩ ፈጣሪ conceived ካብ ?ከም,—,—,—,እቲ Supreme ፍጥረት
"Asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens.

"While attending Ealing Art College, Tim Staffell became friends with Farrokh Bulsara, a fellow student who had assumed the English name of Freddie. Bulsara felt that he and the band had the same tastes and soon became a keen fan of Smile. In late 1970, after Staffell left to join the band Humpy Bong, the remaining Smile members, encouraged by Bulsara, changed their name to ""Queen"" and continued working together. When asked about the name, Bulsara explained, ""I thought up the name Queen. It's just a name, but it's very regal obviously, and it sounds splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. It had a lot of visual potential and was open to all sorts of interpretations.

"The Sahara (Arabic: الصحراء الكبرى‎, aṣ-ṣaḥrāʾ al-kubrā , 'the Greatest Desert') is the largest hot desert in the world. It is the third largest desert after Antarctica and the Arctic. Its surface area of 9,400,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi)[citation needed]—including the Libyan Desert—is comparable to the respective land areas of China or the United States. The desert comprises much of the land found within North Africa, excluding the fertile coastal region situated against the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley of Egypt and Sudan. The Sahara stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north, to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually transitions to a coastal plain. To the south, it is delimited by the Sahel, a belt of semi-arid tropical savanna around the Niger River valley and Sudan Region of Sub-Saharan Africa. The Sahara can be divided into several regions, including the western Sahara, the central Ahaggar Mountains, the Tibesti Mountains, the Aïr Mountains, the Ténéré desert, and the Libyan Desert.

"The polyphony of Christian a cappella music began to develop in Europe around the late 15th century, with compositions by Josquin des Prez. The early a cappella polyphonies may have had an accompanying instrument, although this instrument would merely double the singers' parts and was not independent. By the 16th century, a cappella polyphony had further developed, but gradually, the cantata began to take the place of a cappella forms. 16th century a cappella polyphony, nonetheless, continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day. Recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by Palestrina, such as what was written for the Sistine Chapel was intended to be accompanied by an organ ""doubling"" some or all of the voices. Such is seen in the life of Palestrina becoming a major influence on Bach, most notably in the aforementioned Mass in B Minor. Other composers that utilized the a cappella style, if only for the occasional piece, were Claudio Monteverdi and his masterpiece, Lagrime d'amante al sepolcro dell'amata (A lover's tears at his beloved's grave), which was composed in 1610, and Andrea Gabrieli when upon his death it was discovered many choral pieces, one of which was in the unaccompanied style. Learning from the preceding two composeres, Heinrich Schütz utilized the a cappella style in numerous pieces, chief among these were the pieces in the oratorio style, which were traditionally performed during the Easter week and dealt with the religious subject matter of that week, such as Christ's suffering and the Passion. Five of Schutz's Historien were Easter pieces, and of these the latter three, which dealt with the passion from three different viewpoints, those of Matthew, Luke and John, were all done a cappella style. This was a near requirement for this type of piece, and the parts of the crowd were sung while the solo parts which were the quoted parts from either Christ or the authors were performed in a plainchant.",24,When did Christian a cappella begin to develop in Europe?,two,the late 15th century,three,Christ,2,"እቲ polyphony ካብ Christian ሓደ cappella ሙዚቃ ጀሚሩ ናብ ዕበ አብ ውሽጢ Europe አብ ከባቢ እቲ ረፋድ 15th ,ዘመን ምስ compositions ብ Josquin des .Prez እቲ ብግዘ ሓደ cappella polyphonies ተዝኸዉን ኣለኒ ዝነበረ ሓደ accompanying ,መሳርሒ ዋላ እኳ እዚ መሳርሒ ይኸውን ጥራሕ ዕፅፊ እቲ 'singers parts እና ኔሩ ዘይኮነ .ዓርሱ ዝኸኣለ ብ እቲ 16th ,ዘመን ሓደ cappella polyphony ዝነበረ ርሑቅ ,ምዕቡል ግን ,ብኸይዲ እቲ cantata ጀሚሩ ናብ ውሰድ እቲ ቦታ ካብ ሓደ cappella .forms 16th ዘመን ሓደ cappella ,polyphony ,nonetheless continued ናብ ተፅዕኖ ቤተ ክርስትያን composers በቲ እዚ ግዘ እና ናብ እቲ እዋናዊ .መዓልቲ ናይ ቀረባ ማስረጃ ኣለዎ shown እቲ ንእሽተይ ካብ እቲ ብግዘ ቁርፅራፅ ብ ,Palestrina ከምዚ ከም እንታይ ኔሩ ዝተፀሓፈ ን እቲ Sistine Chapel ኔሩ ዝተዳለወ ናብ ኩን accompanied ብ ሓደ organ """"doubling ንእሽተይ ወይ ኩሎም ካብ እቲ .voices ከምዚ እዩ ተራእዩ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ህይወት ካብ Palestrina becoming ሓደ ዋና ተፅዕኖ አብ ልዕሊ ,Bach ብጥዕሚ notably አብ ውሽጢ እቲ aforementioned መጠን ኣካል አብ ውሽጢ B .ንኡስ ካልእ composers እቲ utilized እቲ ሓደ cappella ,ኣገባብ እንተ ጥራሕ ን እቲ occasional ,ቀራፅ ኔሮም Claudio Monteverdi እና ናቱ ,masterpiece Lagrime 'd'amante al sepolcro 'dell'amata (ሓደ 'lover's ንብዓት ኣብ ናቱ 'beloved's ),መቓብር አየናይ ኔሩ composed አብ ውሽጢ ,1610 እና Andrea Gabrieli መዓዝ ኣብ ግዘ ናቱ ሞት እቲ ነገር ኔሩ discovered ቡዙሕ choral ,ቁርፅራፅ ሓደ ካብ አየናይ ኔሩ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ unaccompanied .ኣገባብ ምምሃር ካብ እቲ preceding ክልተ ,composeres Heinrich Schütz utilized እቲ ሓደ cappella ኣገባብ አብ ውሽጢ numerous ,ቁርፅራፅ ሓለቓ ካብዞም እዚ ኔሮም እቲ ቁርፅራፅ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ oratorio ,ኣገባብ አየናይ ኔሮም traditionally performed አብ እዋን እቲ Easter ሰሙን እና dealt ምስ እቲ ሃይማኖታዊ ዋና ነገር ካብ እቲ ,ሰሙን ከምዚ ከም 'Christ's ይሳቐ እና እቲ .ተፍታው ሓሙሽተ ካብ 'Schutz's Historien ኔሮም Easter ,ቁርፅራፅ እና ካብ እዚ እቲ ጸኒሑ ,ሰለስተ አየናይ dealt ምስ እቲ ተፍታው ካብ ሰለስተ ፍሉይ ,viewpoints እቲኦም ካብ ,Matthew Luke እና ,John ኔሮም ኩሎም ምውዳእ ሓደ cappella .ኣገባብ እዚ ኔሩ ሓደ ጥቃ requirement ን እዚ ዓይነት ካብ ,ቀራፅ እና እቲ parts ካብ እቲ ጭንቕንቕ ኔሮም sung እስካብ እቲ solo parts አየናይ ኔሮም እቲ quoted parts ካብ ወይ Christ ወይ እቲ authors ኔሮም performed አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ .plainchant",መዓዝ ግቡር Christian ሓደ cappella ጀምር ናብ ዕበ አብ ውሽጢ ?Europe,ክልተ,እቲ ረፋድ 15th ዘመን,ሰለስተ,Christ

"Chinese political philosophy dates back to the Spring and Autumn Period, specifically with Confucius in the 6th century BC. Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States period. The major philosophies during the period, Confucianism, Legalism, Mohism, Agrarianism and Taoism, each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as Confucius, Mencius, and Mozi, focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, meritocratic government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and laws. Mohism advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on frugality and ascetism. The Agrarians advocated a peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism. Taoism advocated a proto-anarchism. Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the Qin Dynasty, but was replaced by State Confucianism in the Han Dynasty. Prior to China's adoption of communism, State Confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of China up to the 20th century.",32,In what year did the Chinese political philosophy date back to the Spring and Autumn Period?,the Han Dynasty,"Confucius, Mencius",Mozi,BC,4,"Chinese political ፍልስፍና dates ዝባን ናብ እቲ ፅድያ እና ፅድያ ,ግዘ specifically ምስ Confucius አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 6th ዘመን .BC Chinese political ፍልስፍና ኔሩ ምዕቡል ከም ሓደ ምላሽ ናብ እቲ ማሕበራዊ እና political breakdown ካብ እቲ ሃገር characteristic ካብ እቲ ፅድያ እና ፅድያ ግዘ እና እቲ Warring States .ግዘ እቲ ዋና philosophies አብ እዋን እቲ ,ግዘ ,Confucianism ,Legalism ,Mohism Agrarianism እና ,Taoism ሕድሕድ ዝነበረ ሓደ political ገጽታ ናብ ናቶም philosophical .schools Philosophers ከምዚ ከም ,Confucius ,Mencius እና ,Mozi focused አብ ልዕሊ political unity እና political stability ከም እቲ basis ካብ ናቶም political .philosophies Confucianism advocated ሓደ ,hierarchical meritocratic መንግስቲ መሰረት ዝገበረ አብ ልዕሊ ,ድንጋጸ ,ተኣማንነት እና interpersonal .relationships Legalism advocated ሓደ highly authoritarian መንግስቲ መሰረት ዝገበረ አብ ልዕሊ draconian punishments እና .laws Mohism advocated ሓደ ,communal decentralized መንግስቲ centered አብ ልዕሊ frugality እና .ascetism እቲ Agrarians advocated ሓደ peasant utopian communalism እና .egalitarianism Taoism advocated ሓደ -.proto-anarchism Legalism ኔሩ እቲ ዓብላሊ political ፍልስፍና ካብ እቲ Qin ,Dynasty ግን ኔሩ replaced ብ ግዝኣት Confucianism አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Han .Dynasty ቅድሚያ ናብ 'China's adoption ካብ ,communism ግዝኣት Confucianism remained እቲ ዓብላሊ political ፍልስፍና ካብ China ሓፍ ናብ እቲ 20th .ዘመን",አብ ውሽጢ እንታይ ዓመት ግቡር እቲ Chinese political ፍልስፍና ዕለት ዝባን ናብ እቲ ፅድያ እና ፅድያ ?ግዘ,እቲ Han Dynasty,",Confucius Mencius",Mozi,BC
"Richard Phillips Feynman (/ˈfaɪnmən/; May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) was an American theoretical physicist known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model. For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time.",33,Who was the American theoretical physicist known for his work?,Richard Phillips Feynman,130,ten,Sin-Itiro Tomonaga,1,"Richard Phillips Feynman (//;ˈfaɪnmən ተዝኸዉን ,11 1918 – ለካቲት ,15 )1988 ኔሩ ሓደ American theoretical physicist ፍሉጥ ን ናቱ ስራሕ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ መንገዲ integral formulation ካብ quantum ,mechanics እቲ ሓሳብ ካብ quantum ,electrodynamics እና እቲ physics ካብ እቲ superfluidity ካብ supercooled ፈሳሲ ,helium ከም ደሓን ከም አብ ውሽጢ particle physics ን አየናይ ንሱ proposed እቲ parton .መርኣያ ን ናቱ contributions ናብ እቲ ዕብየት ካብ quantum ,electrodynamics ,Feynman jointly ምስ Julian Schwinger እና -Sin-Itiro ,Tomonaga ዝተቀበለ እቲ Nobel ሽልማት አብ ውሽጢ Physics አብ ውሽጢ .1965 ንሱ ምዕቡል ሓደ widely ዘገልገለ pictorial representation scheme ን እቲ mathematical expressions governing እቲ ፀባይ ካብ subatomic ,particles አየናይ ዳሕራይ ኮይኑ ፍሉጥ ከም Feynman .diagrams አብ እዋን ናቱ ,lifetime Feynman ኮይኑ ሓደ ካብ እቲ -best-known ሳይንቲስት አብ ውሽጢ እቲ .ዓለም አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ 1999 poll ካብ 130 leading physicists worldwide ብ እቲ British journal Physics ዓለም ንሱ ኔሩ ranked ከም ሓደ ካብ እቲ ዓሰርተ greatest physicists ካብ ኩሎም .ግዜ",መን ኔሩ እቲ American theoretical physicist ፍሉጥ ን ናቱ ?ስራሕ,Richard Phillips Feynman,130,ዓሰርተ,-Sin-Itiro Tomonaga

"By far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812. With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were more successful. After defeating Napoleon in 1814, Britain sent large veteran armies to invade New York, raid Washington and capture the key control of the Mississippi River at New Orleans. The New York invasion was a fiasco after the much larger British army retreated to Canada. The raiders succeeded in the burning of Washington on 25 August 1814, but were repulsed in their Chesapeake Bay Campaign at the Battle of Baltimore and the British commander killed. The major invasion in Louisiana was stopped by a one-sided military battle that killed the top three British generals and thousands of soldiers. The winners were the commanding general of the Battle of New Orleans, Major General Andrew Jackson, who became president and the Americans who basked in a victory over a much more powerful nation. The peace treaty proved successful, and the U.S. and Britain never again went to war. The losers were the Indians, who never gained the independent territory in the Midwest promised by Britain.",35,Which war was the largest military effort of the U.S. during this era?,the War of 1812,three,this era,Washington,1,"ብ ርሑቅ እቲ largest ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት ተግባር አብ ውሽጢ አየናይ እቲ United States ሕፁይ አብ እዋን እዚ era ኔሩ እቲ ውግእ ካብ .1812 ምስ Britain locked አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ዋና ውግእ ምስ 'Napoleon's ,France ናቱ ፖሊሲ ኔሩ ናብ ህንጻ American shipments ናብ .France እቲ United States ድሌት ናብ ምፅናሕ ግሉል እስካብ pursuing overseas .ንግዲ Britain ቁረፅ እቲ ንግዲ እና impressed seamen አብ ልዕሊ American ships ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ Royal ,Navy ብዘየገድስ ጽዑቕ .protests Britain supported ሓደ Indian insurrection አብ ውሽጢ እቲ American ,Midwest ምስ እቲ ሽቶ ካብ creating ሓደ Indian ግዝኣት ኣብቲ እቲ ይኸውን ህንጻ American .expansion እቲ United States ኣብ መወዳእታ declared ውግእ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ United Kingdom አብ ውሽጢ ,1812 እቲ መጀመርታ ግዜ እቲ ..U.S ዝነበረ officially declared .ውግእ ዘይኮነ hopeful ካብ defeating እቲ Royal ,Navy እቲ ..U.S attacked እቲ British Empire ብ invading British ,Canada hoping ናብ ጥቅሚ captured ግዝኣት ከም ሓደ bargaining .chip እቲ invasion ካብ Canada ኔሩ ሓደ ,debacle እኳ concurrent wars ምስ መበቆል Americans አብ ልዕሊ እቲ western ቅድሚት ('Tecumseh's ውግእ እና እቲ Creek )ውግእ ኔሮም ቡዙሕ .ዕውት ድሕሪ defeating Napoleon አብ ውሽጢ ,1814 Britain ተላኢኹ ገዚፍ veteran armies ናብ invade ሓድሽ ,York raid Washington እና ምሓዝ እቲ መፍትሕ ምቁጽጻር ካብ እቲ Mississippi ሩባ ኣብ ሓድሽ .Orleans እቲ ሓድሽ York invasion ኔሩ ሓደ fiasco ድሕሪ እቲ ብዙሕ larger British ሰራዊት retreated ናብ .Canada እቲ raiders succeeded አብ ውሽጢ እቲ burning ካብ Washington አብ ልዕሊ 25 ነሓሰ ,1814 ግን ኔሮም repulsed አብ ውሽጢ ናቶም Chesapeake ልሳን ባሕሪ ወፍሪ ኣብ እቲ ውግእ ካብ Baltimore እና እቲ British commander .killed እቲ ዋና invasion አብ ውሽጢ Louisiana ኔሩ stopped ብ ሓደ -one-sided ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት ውግእ እቲ killed እቲ ላዕለዋይ ሰለስተ British generals እና thousands ካብ .soldiers እቲ winners ኔሮም እቲ commanding ሓፈሻዊ ካብ እቲ ውግእ ካብ ሓድሽ ,Orleans ዋና ሓፈሻዊ Andrew ,Jackson መን ኮይኑ ፕረዝደንት እና እቲ Americans መን basked አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ victory ልዕሊ ሓደ ብዙሕ ቡዙሕ ሓያል .nation እቲ ሰላም treaty proved ,ዕውት እና እቲ ..U.S እና Britain ፍፁም ካልኣይ ኬዱ ናብ .ውግእ እቲ losers ኔሮም እቲ ,Indians መን ፍፁም gained እቲ ዓርሱ ዝኸኣለ ግዝኣት አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Midwest promised ብ .Britain",አየናይ ውግእ ኔሩ እቲ largest ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት ፃዕሪ ካብ እቲ ..U.S አብ እዋን እዚ ?era,እቲ ውግእ ካብ 1812,ሰለስተ,እዚ era,Washington

"Historians trace the earliest church labeled ""Baptist"" back to 1609 in Amsterdam, with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor. In accordance with his reading of the New Testament, he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults. Baptist practice spread to England, where the General Baptists considered Christ's atonement to extend to all people, while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect. In 1638, Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies. In the mid-18th century, the First Great Awakening increased Baptist growth in both New England and the South. The Second Great Awakening in the South in the early 19th century increased church membership, as did the preachers' lessening of support for abolition and manumission of slavery, which had been part of the 18th-century teachings.

These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by stool, or directly from another person who is infected. It may be divided into three types: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and if it lasts for more than two weeks, persistent diarrhea. The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present it is also known as dysentery. A number of non-infectious causes may also result in diarrhea, including hyperthyroidism, lactose intolerance, inflammatory bowel disease, a number of medications, and irritable bowel syndrome.

"European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools (scholae monasticae), in which monks and nuns taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century. The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the Latin Church by papal bull as studia generalia and perhaps from cathedral schools. It is possible, however, that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception. Later they were also founded by Kings (University of Naples Federico II, Charles University in Prague, Jagiellonian University in Kraków) or municipal administrations (University of Cologne, University of Erfurt). In the early medieval period, most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education.

Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant.

"Unlike the Spanish milled dollar the U.S. dollar is based upon a decimal system of values. In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol ₥), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol ¢), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; ""dime"" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10¢, while ""eagle"" and ""mill"" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599⁄10. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, ""paper money"" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the ""double eagle"", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as ""fractional currency"", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as ""shinplasters"". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a ""Union"", ""Half Union"", and ""Quarter Union"", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100.",50,What currency is based upon a decimal system of values?,100,less than a dollar,1792,U.S.,4,"Unlike እቲ ስጳኛ milled dollar እቲ ..U.S dollar እዩ መሰረት ዝገበረ ኣብ ግዘ ሓደ decimal ስርዓት ካብ .values አብ ውሽጢ ተወሳኺ ናብ እቲ dollar እቲ coinage ፍፃመ officially ዝተመስረተ monetary units ካብ mill ወይ -one-thousandth ካብ ሓደ dollar (ምልክት ),₥ cent ወይ -one-hundredth ካብ ሓደ dollar (ምልክት ),¢ dime ወይ -one-tenth ካብ ሓደ ,dollar እና ኣሞራ ወይ ዓሰርተ ,dollars ምስ prescribed weights እና ሕዋስ ካብ ,ወርቂ ,ነሓስ ወይ ነሓስ ን .ሕድሕድ እቲ ነገር ኔሩ proposed አብ ውሽጢ እቲ -mid-1800s እቲ ሓደ ሚእቲ dollars ኩን ፍሉጥ ከም ሓደ ,union ግን አይኮንን union coins ኔሮም ብስሩ ወቐዐ እና ጥራሕ patterns ን እቲ $50 ፍርቂ union .ምህላው ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ጥራሕ cents እዮም አብ ውሽጢ everyday ጥቅሚ ከም divisions ካብ እቲ ;dollar """"dime እዩ ዘገልገለ solely ከም እቲ ሽም ካብ እቲ coin ምስ እቲ ዋጋ ካብ ,10¢ እስካብ """"ኣሞራ እና """"mill እዮም largely ዘይፍለጥ ናብ እቲ ሓፈሻዊ ,ህዝባዊ እኳ mills እዮም ሓደ ሓደ ግዘ ዘገልገለ አብ ውሽጢ matters ካብ tax ,levies እና gasoline prices እዮም ብልሙድ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ፎርም ካብ $.X.XX9 per ,gallon ..,e.g $.,3.599 ሓደ ሓደ ግዘ ዝተፀሓፈ ከም $..3.599⁄10 መዓዝ አብዚ ሕዚ issued አብ ውሽጢ circulating ,ፎርም denominations ማዕረ ናብ ወይ ዝወሓደ ካብ ሓደ dollar እዮም emitted ከም ..U.S coins እስካብ denominations ማዕረ ናብ ወይ greater ካብ ሓደ dollar እዮም emitted ከም Federal ምቕማጥ notes (ምስ እቲ ዝተፈለየ ካብ ,ወርቂ ነሓስ እና platinum coins valued ሓፍ ናብ $100 ከም ሕጋዊ ,ለውሃት ግን ዋጋ ርሑቅ ቡዙሕ ከም ).bullion ክልቲኡ -one-dollar coins እና notes እዮም produced ,ሎምዓንቲ ዋላ እኳ እቲ መዝገብ ፎርም እዩ significantly ቡዙሕ .ልሙድ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ,ሕሉፍ ""ወረቐት ""ገንዘብ ኔሩ ሕልፍ ሕልፍ ኢሉ issued አብ ውሽጢ denominations ዝወሓደ ካብ ሓደ dollar (fractional )ገንዘብ እና ወርቂ coins ኔሮም issued ን circulation ሓፍ ናብ እቲ ዋጋ ካብ $20 (ፍሉጥ ከም እቲ ""ዕፅፊ "",ኣሞራ discontinued አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ).1930s እቲ ቃል ኣሞራ ኔሩ ዘገልገለ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Coinage ፍፃመ ካብ 1792 ን እቲ denomination ካብ ዓሰርተ ,dollars እና subsequently ኔሩ ዘገልገለ አብ ውሽጢ naming ወርቂ .coins ወረቐት ገንዘብ ዝወሓደ ካብ ሓደ dollar አብ ውሽጢ ,denomination ፍሉጥ ከም ""fractional "",ገንዘብ ኔሩ እውን ሓደ ሓደ ግዘ pejoratively referred ናብ ከም """".shinplasters አብ ውሽጢ ,1854 James ,Guthrie ሽዑ Secretary ካብ እቲ ,Treasury proposed creating $,100 $50 እና $25 ወርቂ ,coins አየናይ ኔሮም referred ናብ ከም ሓደ """",Union ""ፍርቂ "",Union እና ""ርብዒ "",Union ስለዝኾነ implying ሓደ denomination ካብ 1 Union = $.100",እንታይ ገንዘብ እዩ መሰረት ዝገበረ ኣብ ግዘ ሓደ decimal ስርዓት ካብ ?values,100,ዝወሓደ ካብ ሓደ dollar,1792,..U.S

"The Gregorian calendar was a reform of the Julian calendar instituted in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII, after whom the calendar was named, by papal bull Inter gravissimas dated 24 February 1582. The motivation for the adjustment was to bring the date for the celebration of Easter to the time of year in which it was celebrated when it was introduced by the early Church. Although a recommendation of the First Council of Nicaea in 325 specified that all Christians should celebrate Easter on the same day, it took almost five centuries before virtually all Christians achieved that objective by adopting the rules of the Church of Alexandria (see Easter for the issues which arose).",55,When was the Gregorian calendar first introduced?,the Church of Alexandria,Easter on the same day,1582,Christians,3,"እቲ Gregorian calendar ኔሩ ሓደ reform ካብ እቲ Julian calendar instituted አብ ውሽጢ 1582 ብ Pope Gregory ,XIII ድሕሪ መን እቲ calendar ኔሩ ,named ብ papal ብዕራይ Inter gravissimas dated 24 ለካቲት .1582 እቲ ምልዕዓል ን እቲ adjustment ኔሩ ናብ ኣምፅእ እቲ ዕለት ን እቲ celebration ካብ Easter ናብ እቲ ግዜ ካብ ዓመት አብ ውሽጢ አየናይ እቲ ነገር ኔሩ celebrated መዓዝ እቲ ነገር ኔሩ introduced ብ እቲ ብግዘ .ቤተ ክርስትያን ዋላ እኳ ሓደ recommendation ካብ እቲ መጀመርታ ዋዕላ ካብ Nicaea አብ ውሽጢ 325 specified እቲ ኩሎም Christians ይሓይሽ ምኽባር Easter አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ማዕረ ,መዓልቲ እቲ ነገር ምውሳድ ዳርጋ ሓሙሽተ centuries ቅድሚ virtually ኩሎም Christians achieved እቲ ዕላማ ብ adopting እቲ ስርዓታት ካብ እቲ ቤተ ክርስትያን ካብ Alexandria (ረአ Easter ን እቲ ፀገማት አየናይ ).arose",መዓዝ ኔሩ እቲ Gregorian calendar መጀመርታ ?introduced,እቲ ቤተ ክርስትያን ካብ Alexandria,Easter አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ማዕረ መዓልቲ,1582,Christians

"Roman government was headed by two consuls, elected annually by the citizens and advised by a senate composed of appointed magistrates. As Roman society was very hierarchical by modern standards, the evolution of the Roman government was heavily influenced by the struggle between the patricians, Rome's land-holding aristocracy, who traced their ancestry to the founding of Rome, and the plebeians, the far more numerous citizen-commoners. Over time, the laws that gave patricians exclusive rights to Rome's highest offices were repealed or weakened, and leading plebeian families became full members of the aristocracy. The leaders of the Republic developed a strong tradition and morality requiring public service and patronage in peace and war, making military and political success inextricably linked. Many of Rome's legal and legislative structures (later codified into the Justinian Code, and again into the Napoleonic Code) can still be observed throughout Europe and much of the world in modern nation states and international organizations.",63,How many consuls were elected to the Roman government annually?,the Justinian Code,two,the Napoleonic Code,senate,2,"Roman መንግስቲ ኔሩ headed ብ ክልተ ,consuls elected annually ብ እቲ citizens እና advised ብ ሓደ senate composed ካብ appointed .magistrates ከም Roman ሕብረተሰብ ኔሩ ብጣዕሚ hierarchical ብ ዘበናዊ ,standards እቲ ደፋእታዊ ለውጢ ካብ እቲ Roman መንግስቲ ኔሩ heavily influenced ብ እቲ ገልታዕታዕ አብ መንጎ እቲ ,patricians 'Rome's -land-holding ,aristocracy መን traced ናቶም ancestry ናብ እቲ founding ካብ ,Rome እና እቲ ,plebeians እቲ ርሑቅ ቡዙሕ numerous -.citizen-commoners ልዕሊ ,ግዜ እቲ laws እቲ ሂቡ patricians ንበይኑ rights ናብ 'Rome's highest offices ኔሮም repealed ወይ ,weakened እና leading plebeian families ኮይኑ ሙሉእ members ካብ እቲ .aristocracy እቲ leaders ካብ እቲ Republic ምዕቡል ሓደ ጠንካራ ልምዲ እና morality requiring ህዝባዊ ግልጋሎት እና patronage አብ ውሽጢ ሰላም እና ,ውግእ making ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት እና political ዓወት inextricably .linked ቡዙሕ ካብ 'Rome's ሕጋዊ እና legislative structures (ዳሕራይ codified ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ Justinian ,Code እና ካልኣይ ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ Napoleonic )Code ይኽእል እስካብ ሕዚ ኩን observed በቲ Europe እና ብዙሕ ካብ እቲ ዓለም አብ ውሽጢ ዘበናዊ nation states እና ዓለም ለኻዊ .organizations",ከመይ ቡዙሕ consuls ኔሮም elected ናብ እቲ Roman መንግስቲ ?annually,እቲ Justinian Code,ክልተ,እቲ Napoleonic Code,senate
"Presbyterianism is a part of the Reformed tradition within Protestantism which traces its origins to the British Isles. Presbyterian churches derive their name from the presbyterian form of church government, which is governed by representative assemblies of elders. Many Reformed churches are organized this way, but the word ""Presbyterian,"" when capitalized, is often applied uniquely to the churches that trace their roots to the Scottish and English churches that bore that name and English political groups that formed during the English Civil War. Presbyterian theology typically emphasizes the sovereignty of God, the authority of the Scriptures, and the necessity of grace through faith in Christ. Presbyterian church government was ensured in Scotland by the Acts of Union in 1707 which created the kingdom of Great Britain. In fact, most Presbyterians found in England can trace a Scottish connection, and the Presbyterian denomination was also taken to North America mostly by Scots and Scots-Irish immigrants. The Presbyterian denominations in Scotland hold to the theology of John Calvin and his immediate successors, although there are a range of theological views within contemporary Presbyterianism. Local congregations of churches which use presbyterian polity are governed by sessions made up of representatives of the congregation (elders); a conciliar approach which is found at other levels of decision-making (presbytery, synod and general assembly).",64,Which denomination is associated with the Reformed tradition within Protestantism?,Presbyterian,English,North America,the Acts of Union,1,"Presbyterianism እዩ ሓደ ክፋል ካብ እቲ Reformed ልምዲ አብ ውሽጢ Protestantism አየናይ traces ናቱ origins ናብ እቲ British .Isles Presbyterian churches derive ናቶም ሽም ካብ እቲ presbyterian ፎርም ካብ ቤተ ክርስትያን ,መንግስቲ አየናይ እዩ governed ብ representative assemblies ካብ .elders ቡዙሕ Reformed churches እዮም organized እዚ ,መንገዲ ግን እቲ ቃል "",""Presbyterian መዓዝ ,capitalized እዩ ኩል ግዘ applied uniquely ናብ እቲ churches እቲ ኣሰር ናቶም roots ናብ እቲ Scottish እና ኢንግሊሽ churches እቲ ደባሪ እቲ ሽም እና ኢንግሊሽ political groups እቲ formed አብ እዋን እቲ ኢንግሊሽ Civil .ውግእ Presbyterian theology typically emphasizes እቲ sovereignty ካብ ,ፈጣሪ እቲ ምምሕዳር ካብ እቲ ,Scriptures እና እቲ necessity ካብ grace ብውሽጢ እምነት አብ ውሽጢ .Christ Presbyterian ቤተ ክርስትያን መንግስቲ ኔሩ ensured አብ ውሽጢ Scotland ብ እቲ Acts ካብ Union አብ ውሽጢ 1707 አየናይ created እቲ kingdom ካብ ምዑዝ .Britain አብ ውሽጢ ,ሓቂ ብጥዕሚ Presbyterians ተረኺቡ አብ ውሽጢ England ይኽእል ኣሰር ሓደ Scottish ,connection እና እቲ Presbyterian denomination ኔሩ እውን ተወሲዱ ናብ ሰሜን America መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ብ Scots እና -Scots-Irish .immigrants እቲ Presbyterian denominations አብ ውሽጢ Scotland ሓዝ ናብ እቲ theology ካብ John Calvin እና ናቱ ሽዕ ንሻዕ ,successors ዋላ እኳ ኣብቲ እዮም ሓደ ግዝፈት ካብ theological views አብ ውሽጢ ወቕታዊ .Presbyterianism ወሽጣዊ congregations ካብ churches አየናይ ጥቅሚ presbyterian polity እዮም governed ብ sessions ዝተሰርሐ ሓፍ ካብ representatives ካብ እቲ congregation ();elders ሓደ conciliar ቅረብ አየናይ እዩ ተረኺቡ ኣብ ካልእ levels ካብ -decision-making (,presbytery synod እና ሓፈሻዊ ).ኣኼባ",አየናይ denomination እዩ ተሓባበረ ምስ እቲ Reformed ልምዲ አብ ውሽጢ ?Protestantism,Presbyterian,ኢንግሊሽ,ሰሜን America,እቲ Acts ካብ Union

"By the 1890s the profound effect of adrenal extracts on many different tissue types had been discovered, setting off a search both for the mechanism of chemical signalling and efforts to exploit these observations for the development of new drugs. The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897 John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis. Parke Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name Adrenalin. Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist).

"Incandescent bulbs are much less efficient than most other types of electric lighting; incandescent bulbs convert less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light, with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2%. The remaining energy is converted into heat. The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb is 16 lumens per watt, compared with 60 lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150 lm/W for some white LED lamps. Some applications of the incandescent bulb deliberately use the heat generated by the filament. Such applications include incubators, brooding boxes for poultry, heat lights for reptile tanks, infrared heating for industrial heating and drying processes, lava lamps, and the Easy-Bake Oven toy. Incandescent bulbs typically have short lifetimes compared with other types of lighting; around 1,000 hours for home light bulbs versus typically 10,000 hours for compact fluorescents and 30,000 hours for lighting LEDs.",75,What percentage of energy do incandescent bulbs convert into visible light?,less than 5%,the Easy-Bake Oven,16 lumens per watt,lava lamps,1,"Incandescent bulbs እዮም ብዙሕ ዝወሓደ ስሉጥ ካብ ብጥዕሚ ካልእ types ካብ electric ;lighting incandescent bulbs ቀይር ዝወሓደ ካብ %5 ካብ እቲ ጉልበት ንሶም ጥቅሚ ናብ ውሽጢ visible ,ብርሃን ምስ መለክዒ ብርሃን bulbs averaging ብዝዕባ .%.2.2 እቲ ዝተረፈ ጉልበት እዩ converted ናብ ውሽጢ .ሙቀት እቲ luminous efficacy ካብ ሓደ ዝተለመደ incandescent bulb እዩ 16 lumens per ,watt compared ምስ 60 /lm/W ን ሓደ compact fluorescent bulb ወይ 150 /lm/W ን ንእሽተይ ፃዕዳ መረሐ .lamps ንእሽተይ applications ካብ እቲ incandescent bulb deliberately ጥቅሚ እቲ ሙቀት generated ብ እቲ .filament ከምዚ applications ይሓውስ ,incubators brooding boxes ን ,poultry ሙቀት lights ን reptile ,tanks infrared heating ን industrial heating እና drying ,processes lava ,lamps እና እቲ -Easy-Bake እቶን .toy Incandescent bulbs typically ኣለኒ ሓፂር lifetimes compared ምስ ካልእ types ካብ ;lighting አብ ከባቢ ,1,000 ሰዓታት ን ገዛ ብርሃን bulbs versus typically ,10,000 ሰዓታት ን compact fluorescents እና ,30,000 ሰዓታት ን lighting .LEDs",እንታይ percentage ካብ ጉልበት ግበር incandescent bulbs ቀይር ናብ ውሽጢ visible ?ብርሃን,ዝወሓደ ካብ %5,እቲ -Easy-Bake እቶን,16 lumens per watt,lava lamps
"Royal assent is the method by which a country's constitutional monarch (possibly through a delegated official) formally approves an act of that nation's parliament, thus making it a law or letting it be promulgated as law. In the vast majority of contemporary monarchies, this act is considered to be little more than a formality; even in those nations which still permit their ruler to withhold the royal assent (such as the United Kingdom, Norway, and Liechtenstein), the monarch almost never does so, save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government. While the power to withhold royal assent was once exercised often in European monarchies, it is exceedingly rare in the modern, democratic political atmosphere that has developed there since the 18th century.",76,What is the term that describes the method of when the monarch approves an act of a nation's parliament?,the United Kingdom,Liechtenstein,Royal,Norway,3,"Royal assent እዩ እቲ ሜላ ብ አየናይ ሓደ 'country's constitutional monarch (possibly ብውሽጢ ሓደ delegated )ዘፍለጠ formally approves ሓደ ፍፃመ ካብ እቲ 'nation's ,parliament ስለዝኾነ making እቲ ነገር ሓደ ሕጊ ወይ letting እቲ ነገር ኩን promulgated ከም .ሕጊ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ሰፊሕ መብዛሕትኡ ካብ ወቕታዊ ,monarchies እዚ ፍፃመ እዩ ገምገመ ናብ ኩን ንእሽተይ ቡዙሕ ካብ ሓደ ;formality ሙሉእ አብ ውሽጢ እቲኦም nations አየናይ እስካብ ሕዚ ፍቓድ ናቶም መስመርያ ናብ withhold እቲ royal assent (ከምዚ ከም እቲ United ,Kingdom ,Norway እና ),Liechtenstein እቲ monarch ዳርጋ ፍፁም ምግባር ,ስለዚ ምቑጣብ አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ dire political ህጹጽ ወይ ኣብ ግዘ እቲ ምኽሪ ካብ ናቶም .መንግስቲ እስካብ እቲ ሓይሊ ናብ withhold royal assent ኔሩ ሓንሳዕ exercised ኩል ግዘ አብ ውሽጢ European ,monarchies እቲ ነገር እዩ exceedingly ብበዝሒ ዘይርከብ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ,ዘበናዊ democratic political atmosphere እቲ ኣለዎ ምዕቡል ኣብቲ ካብ እቲ 18th .ዘመን",እንታይ እዩ እቲ ቃል እቲ describes እቲ ሜላ ካብ መዓዝ እቲ monarch approves ሓደ ፍፃመ ካብ ሓደ 'nation's ?parliament,እቲ United Kingdom,Liechtenstein,Royal,Norway

"The Republic of Liberia, beginning as a settlement of the American Colonization Society (ACS), declared its independence on July 26, 1847. The United States did not recognize Liberia's independence until during the American Civil War on February 5, 1862.

"An antenna (plural antennae or antennas), or aerial, is an electrical device which converts electric power into radio waves, and vice versa. It is usually used with a radio transmitter or radio receiver. In transmission, a radio transmitter supplies an electric current oscillating at radio frequency (i.e. a high frequency alternating current (AC)) to the antenna's terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as electromagnetic waves (radio waves). In reception, an antenna intercepts some of the power of an electromagnetic wave in order to produce a tiny voltage at its terminals, that is applied to a receiver to be amplified.",93,What is an electrical device that converts electric power into radio waves?,antenna,AC,dipole.n.02,omnidirectional antenna.n.01,1,"ሓደ antenna (ብዙሕ antennae ወይ ),antennas ወይ ,aerial እዩ ሓደ electrical መሳርሒ አየናይ converts electric ሓይሊ ናብ ውሽጢ radio ,waves እና vice .versa እቲ ነገር እዩ ብልሙድ ዘገልገለ ምስ ሓደ radio transmitter ወይ radio .receiver አብ ውሽጢ ,transmission ሓደ radio transmitter supplies ሓደ electric እዋናዊ oscillating ኣብ radio ድግግም (..i.e ሓደ ላዕሊ ድግግም alternating እዋናዊ ())AC ናብ እቲ 'antenna's ,terminals እና እቲ antenna radiates እቲ ጉልበት ካብ እቲ እዋናዊ ከም electromagnetic waves (radio ).waves አብ ውሽጢ ,መቐበሊ ጋሻ ሓደ antenna intercepts ንእሽተይ ካብ እቲ ሓይሊ ካብ ሓደ electromagnetic ማዕበል አብ ውሽጢ ስርዓት ናብ ምፍራይ ሓደ ደቃቅ voltage ኣብ ናቱ ,terminals እቲ እዩ applied ናብ ሓደ receiver ናብ ኩን .amplified",እንታይ እዩ ሓደ electrical መሳርሒ እቲ converts electric ሓይሊ ናብ ውሽጢ radio ?waves,antenna,AC,..dipole.n.02,omnidirectional ..antenna.n.01
"The Gregorian calendar was a reform of the Julian calendar instituted in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII, after whom the calendar was named, by papal bull Inter gravissimas dated 24 February 1582. The motivation for the adjustment was to bring the date for the celebration of Easter to the time of year in which it was celebrated when it was introduced by the early Church. Although a recommendation of the First Council of Nicaea in 325 specified that all Christians should celebrate Easter on the same day, it took almost five centuries before virtually all Christians achieved that objective by adopting the rules of the Church of Alexandria (see Easter for the issues which arose).",94,Who created the Gregorian calendar?,Easter on the same day,almost five centuries,Pope Gregory XIII,Inter,3,"እቲ Gregorian calendar ኔሩ ሓደ reform ካብ እቲ Julian calendar instituted አብ ውሽጢ 1582 ብ Pope Gregory ,XIII ድሕሪ መን እቲ calendar ኔሩ ,named ብ papal ብዕራይ Inter gravissimas dated 24 ለካቲት .1582 እቲ ምልዕዓል ን እቲ adjustment ኔሩ ናብ ኣምፅእ እቲ ዕለት ን እቲ celebration ካብ Easter ናብ እቲ ግዜ ካብ ዓመት አብ ውሽጢ አየናይ እቲ ነገር ኔሩ celebrated መዓዝ እቲ ነገር ኔሩ introduced ብ እቲ ብግዘ .ቤተ ክርስትያን ዋላ እኳ ሓደ recommendation ካብ እቲ መጀመርታ ዋዕላ ካብ Nicaea አብ ውሽጢ 325 specified እቲ ኩሎም Christians ይሓይሽ ምኽባር Easter አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ማዕረ ,መዓልቲ እቲ ነገር ምውሳድ ዳርጋ ሓሙሽተ centuries ቅድሚ virtually ኩሎም Christians achieved እቲ ዕላማ ብ adopting እቲ ስርዓታት ካብ እቲ ቤተ ክርስትያን ካብ Alexandria (ረአ Easter ን እቲ ፀገማት አየናይ ).arose",መን created እቲ Gregorian ?calendar,Easter አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ማዕረ መዓልቲ,ዳርጋ ሓሙሽተ centuries,Pope Gregory XIII,Inter

"The beginning of the Neolithic culture is considered to be in the Levant (Jericho, modern-day West Bank) about 10,200 – 8,800 BC. It developed directly from the Epipaleolithic Natufian culture in the region, whose people pioneered the use of wild cereals, which then evolved into true farming. The Natufian period was between 12,000 and 10,200 BC, and the so-called ""proto-Neolithic"" is now included in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPNA) between 10,200 and 8,800 BC.

"Nonverbal communication describes the process of conveying meaning in the form of non-word messages. Examples of nonverbal communication include haptic communication, chronemic communication, gestures, body language, facial expression, eye contact, and how one dresses. Nonverbal communication also relates to intent of a message. Examples of intent are voluntary, intentional movements like shaking a hand or winking, as well as involuntary, such as sweating. Speech also contains nonverbal elements known as paralanguage, e.g. rhythm, intonation, tempo, and stress. There may even be a pheromone component.

"There are many styles of mandolin, but four are common, the Neapolitan or round-backed mandolin, the carved-top mandolin and the flat-backed mandolin. The round-back has a deep bottom, constructed of strips of wood, glued together into a bowl. The carved-top or arch-top mandolin has a much shallower, arched back, and an arched top—both carved out of wood. The flat-backed mandolin uses thin sheets of wood for the body, braced on the inside for strength in a similar manner to a guitar. Each style of instrument has its own sound quality and is associated with particular forms of music. Neapolitan mandolins feature prominently in European classical music and traditional music. Carved-top instruments are common in American folk music and bluegrass music. Flat-backed instruments are commonly used in Irish, British and Brazilian folk music.

Securing an early return to the United States, Kerry joined the Vietnam Veterans Against the War organization in which he served as a nationally recognized spokesman and as an outspoken opponent of the Vietnam War.

"By the 1890s the profound effect of adrenal extracts on many different tissue types had been discovered, setting off a search both for the mechanism of chemical signalling and efforts to exploit these observations for the development of new drugs. The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897 John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis. Parke Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name Adrenalin. Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist). By 1929 epinephrine had been formulated into an inhaler for use in the treatment of nasal congestion.",102,When did adrenal extracts first appear on many different tissue types?,Adrenalin,Johns Hopkins University,the 1890s,Primatene Mist,3,"ብ እቲ 1890s እቲ ዓሚቚ ፅልዋ ካብ adrenal extracts አብ ልዕሊ ቡዙሕ ፍሉይ ቲሹ types ዝነበረ ዝነበረ ,discovered ምምላእ ምጥፋእ ሓደ ምድላይ ክልቲኡ ን እቲ mechanism ካብ chemical signalling እና efforts ናብ ኣማዕበለ እዚ observations ን እቲ ዕብየት ካብ ሓድሽ .drugs እቲ ደም ፀቅጢ raising እና vasoconstrictive effects ካብ adrenal extracts ኔሮም ካብ ብፍሉይ ወለድ ናብ surgeons ከም hemostatic agents እና ከም ህክምና ን ,shock እና ሓደ ቑጽሪ ካብ companies ምዕቡል products መሰረት ዝገበረ አብ ልዕሊ adrenal extracts containing varying purities ካብ እቲ ንቑሕ .ዓውደ ኣካል አብ ውሽጢ 1897 John Abel ካብ Johns Hopkins ዩኒቨርሲቲ identified እቲ ንቑሕ principle ከም ,epinephrine አየናይ ንሱ ዝተገለለ አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ impure ግዝኣት ከም እቲ sulfate .ጨው Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine ዳሕራይ ምዕቡል ሓደ ሜላ ን obtaining epinephrine አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ፅሩይ ,ግዝኣት እና licensed እቲ ቴክኖሎጂ ናብ Parke .Davis Parke Davis marketed epinephrine ትሕቲ እቲ ንግዲ ሽም .Adrenalin Injected epinephrine proved ናብ ኩን ብፍላይ efficacious ን እቲ ኣፀጋሚ ህክምና ካብ asthma ,attacks እና ሓደ inhaled ሕታም ኔሩ ሽዩጥ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ United States ክሳብ 2011 (Primatene ).ግመ ብ 1929 epinephrine ዝነበረ ዝነበረ formulated ናብ ውሽጢ ሓደ inhaler ን ጥቅሚ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ህክምና ካብ nasal .congestion",መዓዝ ግቡር adrenal extracts መጀመርታ ምርካብ አብ ልዕሊ ቡዙሕ ፍሉይ ቲሹ ?types,Adrenalin,Johns Hopkins ዩኒቨርሲቲ,እቲ 1890s,Primatene ግመ

"The Ming initiated sporadic armed intervention in Tibet during the 14th century, but did not garrison permanent troops there. At times the Tibetans also used armed resistance against Ming forays. The Wanli Emperor (r. 1572–1620) made attempts to reestablish Sino-Tibetan relations after the Mongol-Tibetan alliance initiated in 1578, which affected the foreign policy of the subsequent Qing dynasty (1644–1912) of China in their support for the Dalai Lama of the Gelug school. By the late 16th century, the Mongols were successful armed protectors of the Gelug Dalai Lama, after increasing their presence in the Amdo region.

Pebble mosaics were made in Tiryns in Mycenean Greece; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times, both in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. Early Christian basilicas from the 4th century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics. Mosaic art flourished in the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 15th centuries; that tradition was adopted by the Norman kingdom in Sicily in the 12th century, by eastern-influenced Venice, and among the Rus in Ukraine. Mosaic fell out of fashion in the Renaissance, though artists like Raphael continued to practise the old technique.

"Mikhail Gorbachev was elected General Secretary by the Politburo on March 11, 1985, three hours after predecessor Konstantin Chernenko's death at age 73. Gorbachev, aged 54, was the youngest member of the Politburo. His initial goal as general secretary was to revive the Soviet economy, and he realized that doing so would require reforming underlying political and social structures. The reforms began with personnel changes of senior Brezhnev-era officials who would impede political and economic change. On April 23, 1985, Gorbachev brought two protégés, Yegor Ligachev and Nikolai Ryzhkov, into the Politburo as full members. He kept the ""power"" ministries happy by promoting KGB Head Viktor Chebrikov from candidate to full member and appointing Minister of Defence Marshal Sergei Sokolov as a Politburo candidate.",127,How old was Gorbachev when he was elected to office as General Secretary?,Nikolai Ryzhkov,"April 23, 1985",54,Mikhail Gorbachev,3,"Mikhail Gorbachev ኔሩ elected ሓፈሻዊ Secretary ብ እቲ Politburo አብ ልዕሊ መጋቢት ,11 ,1985 ሰለስተ ሰዓታት ድሕሪ predecessor Konstantin 'Chernenko's ሞት ኣብ ዕድመ .73 ,Gorbachev aged ,54 ኔሩ እቲ youngest member ካብ እቲ .Politburo ናቱ መጀመሪ ሽቶ ከም ሓፈሻዊ secretary ኔሩ ናብ revive እቲ Soviet ,ቁጠባ እና ንሱ ዘልእለማዊ እቲ ተግባር ስለዚ ይኸውን ይደሊ reforming underlying political እና ማሕበራዊ .structures እቲ reforms ጀሚሩ ምስ personnel changes ካብ ላዕለዋይ -Brezhnev-era officials መን ይኸውን impede political እና ቁጠባዊ .ለውጢ አብ ልዕሊ ጉንበት ,23 ,1985 Gorbachev ምምፃእ ክልተ ,protégés Yegor Ligachev እና Nikolai ,Ryzhkov ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ Politburo ከም ሙሉእ .members ንሱ ዝተዓቀበ እቲ """"ሓይሊ ministries ሕጉስ ብ promoting KGB ርእሲ Viktor Chebrikov ካብ candidate ናብ ሙሉእ member እና appointing Minister ካብ Defence Marshal Sergei Sokolov ከም ሓደ Politburo .candidate",ከመይ ዓብይ ኔሩ Gorbachev መዓዝ ንሱ ኔሩ elected ናብ ቤት-ፅሕፈት ከም ሓፈሻዊ ?Secretary,Nikolai Ryzhkov,"ጉንበት ,23 1985",54,Mikhail Gorbachev

"Roncalli was elected pope on 28 October 1958 at age 76 after 11 ballots. His selection was unexpected, and Roncalli himself had come to Rome with a return train ticket to Venice. He was the first pope to take the pontifical name of ""John"" upon election in more than 500 years, and his choice settled the complicated question of official numbering attached to this papal name due to the antipope of this name. Pope John XXIII surprised those who expected him to be a caretaker pope by calling the historic Second Vatican Council (1962–65), the first session opening on 11 October 1962. His passionate views on equality were summed up in his famous statement, ""We were all made in God's image, and thus, we are all Godly alike."" John XXIII made many passionate speeches during his pontificate, one of which was on the day that he opened the Second Vatican Council in the middle of the night to the crowd gathered in St. Peter's Square: ""Dear children, returning home, you will find children: give your children a hug and say: This is a hug from the Pope!""",139,At what age was Roncalli elected pope?,Godly,Venice,age 76,the day,3,"Roncalli ኔሩ elected pope አብ ልዕሊ 28 ጥቅምቲ 1958 ኣብ ዕድመ 76 ድሕሪ 11 .ballots ናቱ selection ኔሩ ,unexpected እና Roncalli himself ዝነበረ ንዓ ናብ Rome ምስ ሓደ ተመለስ ባቡር ticket ናብ .Venice ንሱ ኔሩ እቲ መጀመርታ pope ናብ ውሰድ እቲ pontifical ሽም ካብ """"John ኣብ ግዘ election አብ ውሽጢ ቡዙሕ ካብ 500 ,ዓመታት እና ናቱ ምርጫ settled እቲ ውስብስብ ሕቶ ካብ ዘፍለጠ numbering ጥባቕ ናብ እዚ papal ሽም መወዳእታ ናብ እቲ antipope ካብ እዚ .ሽም Pope John XXIII ዝተገረመ እቲኦም መን ዝፅበ ንሱ ናብ ኩን ሓደ caretaker pope ብ calling እቲ historic ካልኣይ Vatican ዋዕላ (),1962–65 እቲ መጀመርታ ፕሮግራም opening አብ ልዕሊ 11 ጥቅምቲ .1962 ናቱ ስምዒታዊ views አብ ልዕሊ equality ኔሮም summed ሓፍ አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ ተፈላጢ ,ዓንቀፅ ""ንሕና ኔሮም ኩሎም ዝተሰርሐ አብ ውሽጢ 'God's ,ስእሊ እና ,ስለዝኾነ ንሕና እዮም ኩሎም Godly .""alike John XXIII ዝተሰርሐ ቡዙሕ ስምዒታዊ speeches አብ እዋን ናቱ ,pontificate ሓደ ካብ አየናይ ኔሩ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ መዓልቲ እቲ ንሱ opened እቲ ካልኣይ Vatican ዋዕላ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ማእኸል ካብ እቲ ምሸት ናብ እቲ ጭንቕንቕ gathered አብ ውሽጢ .ቅዱስ 'Peter's :ርባዕ ""ፍትውቲ ,ቖልዑ returning ,ገዛ ንስኻ ንመፃእ ርኸብ :ቖልዑ ሃብ ናትካ ቖልዑ ሓደ ምሕቋፍ እና :በል እዚ እዩ ሓደ ምሕቋፍ ካብ እቲ !""Pope",ኣብ እንታይ ዕድመ ኔሩ Roncalli elected ?pope,Godly,Venice,ዕድመ 76,እቲ መዓልቲ

"A capacitor (originally known as a condenser) is a passive two-terminal electrical component used to store electrical energy temporarily in an electric field. The forms of practical capacitors vary widely, but all contain at least two electrical conductors (plates) separated by a dielectric (i.e. an insulator that can store energy by becoming polarized). The conductors can be thin films, foils or sintered beads of metal or conductive electrolyte, etc. The nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity. Materials commonly used as dielectrics include glass, ceramic, plastic film, air, vacuum, paper, mica, and oxide layers. Capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices. Unlike a resistor, an ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy. Instead, a capacitor stores energy in the form of an electrostatic field between its plates.",143,How many conductors does a capacitor have in order to store energy temporarily in an electric field?,—,—,two,at least two,4,"ሓደ capacitor (originally ፍሉጥ ከም ሓደ )condenser እዩ ሓደ ዝንጉዕ -two-terminal electrical component ዘገልገለ ናብ መኽዝን electrical ጉልበት temporarily አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ electric .ሜዳ እቲ forms ካብ ብተግባር capacitors ይፈላለ ,widely ግን ኩሎም ይሕዝ ኣብ ዝነኣሰ ክልተ electrical conductors ()plates separated ብ ሓደ dielectric (..i.e ሓደ insulator እቲ ይኽእል መኽዝን ጉልበት ብ becoming ).polarized እቲ conductors ይኽእል ኩን ቀጢን ,films foils ወይ sintered beads ካብ ሓጺን ወይ conductive ,electrolyte .ወዘተ እቲ nonconducting dielectric acts ናብ ወስኽ እቲ 'capacitor's ኣኽፍል .ትኽእሎ Materials commonly ዘገልገለ ከም dielectrics ይሓውስ ,ብርጭቆ ,ceramic plastic ,ፊልሚ ,ኣየር ,ህዋ ,ወረቐት ,mica እና oxide .layers Capacitors እዮም widely ዘገልገለ ከም parts ካብ electrical circuits አብ ውሽጢ ቡዙሕ ልሙድ electrical .devices Unlike ሓደ ,resistor ሓደ ተስማዕማዒ capacitor ምግባር ዘይኮነ dissipate .ጉልበት ,ከክንዲ ሓደ capacitor stores ጉልበት አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ፎርም ካብ ሓደ electrostatic ሜዳ አብ መንጎ ናቱ .plates",ከመይ ቡዙሕ conductors ምግባር ሓደ capacitor ኣለኒ አብ ውሽጢ ስርዓት ናብ መኽዝን ጉልበት temporarily አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ electric ?ሜዳ,—,—,ክልተ,ኣብ ዝነኣሰ ክልተ

Growing irritated with his subordinate position to Henry II and increasingly worried that John might be given additional lands and castles at his expense, Henry the Young King travelled to Paris and allied himself with Louis VII. Eleanor, irritated by her husband's persistent interference in Aquitaine, encouraged Richard and Geoffrey to join their brother Henry in Paris. Henry II triumphed over the coalition of his sons, but was generous to them in the peace settlement agreed at Montlouis.

"As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students.

In 1819 the island of Funafuti was named Ellice's Island; the name Ellice was applied to all nine islands after the work of English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay. The islands came under Britain's sphere of influence in the late 19th century, when each of the Ellice Islands was declared a British Protectorate by Captain Gibson of HMS Curacoa between 9 and 16 October 1892.

"Madonna Louise Ciccone (/tʃɪˈkoʊni/; Italian: [tʃikˈkoːne]; born August 16, 1958) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and businesswoman. She achieved popularity by pushing the boundaries of lyrical content in mainstream popular music and imagery in her music videos, which became a fixture on MTV.

"The phonograph disc record was the primary medium used for music reproduction until late in the 20th century, replacing the phonograph cylinder record–with which it had co-existed from the late 1880s through to the 1920s–by the late 1920s. Records retained the largest market share even when new formats such as compact cassette were mass-marketed. By the late 1980s, digital media, in the form of the compact disc, had gained a larger market share, and the vinyl record left the mainstream in 1991. From the 1990s to the 2010s, records continued to be manufactured and sold on a much smaller scale, and were especially used by disc jockeys (DJ)s, released by artists in some genres, and listened to by a niche market of audiophiles. The phonograph record has made a niche resurgence in the early 21st century – 9.2 million records were sold in the U.S. in 2014, a 260% increase since 2009.

"Earth was initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies. Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The Moon formed soon afterwards, possibly as the result of a Mars-sized object with about 10% of the Earth's mass impacting the planet in a glancing blow. Some of this object's mass merged with the Earth, significantly altering its internal composition, and a portion was ejected into space. Some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon.

"The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as The Adventures of Tintin. American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (manga) propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. Comics has had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia.",158,When did comics go to a worldwide audience?,Superman,Belgium,the mid-20th century,Osamu Tezuka,3,"እቲ ታሪኽ ካብ comics ኣለዎ followed ፍሉይ paths አብ ውሽጢ ፍሉይ .cultures Scholars ኣለኒ posited ሓደ -pre-history ከም ርሑቅ ዝባን ከም እቲ Lascaux ባዓቲ .paintings ብ እቲ -mid-20th ,ዘመን comics flourished ብፍላይ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ United ,States western Europe (ብፍላይ አብ ውሽጢ France እና ),Belgium እና .Japan እቲ ታሪኽ ካብ European comics እዩ ኩል ግዘ traced ናብ Rodolphe 'Töpffer's cartoon strips ካብ እቲ ,1830s እና ኮይኑ ህቡብ ምኽታል እቲ ዓወት አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 1930s ካብ strips እና books ከምዚ ከም እቲ Adventures ካብ .Tintin American comics emerged ከም ሓደ መጠን ኣካል ማእኸላይ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ብግዘ 20th ዘመን ምስ እቲ advent ካብ newspaper comic ;strips -magazine-style comic books followed አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ,1930s አብ ውሽጢ አየናይ እቲ superhero ወግዒ ኮይኑ ጠቃሚ ድሕሪ Superman ወፀ አብ ውሽጢ .1938 Histories ካብ Japanese comics እና cartooning ()manga propose origins ከም ብግዘ ከም እቲ 12th .ዘመን ዘበናዊ comic strips emerged አብ ውሽጢ Japan አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ብግዘ 20th ,ዘመን እና እቲ output ካብ comics magazines እና books ብቕልጡፍ expanded አብ ውሽጢ እቲ -post-World ውግእ II era ምስ እቲ popularity ካብ cartoonists ከምዚ ከም Osamu .Tezuka Comics ኣለዎ ዝነበረ ሓደ lowbrow ክብሪ ን ብዙሕ ካብ ናቱ ,ታሪኽ ግን ናብ ገፅ እቲ መወዳእታ ካብ እቲ 20th ዘመን ጀሚሩ ናብ ርኸብ greater acceptance ምስ እቲ ህዝባዊ እና አብ ውሽጢ .academia",መዓዝ ግቡር comics ኪድ ናብ ሓደ worldwide ?ተመልካቲ,Superman,Belgium,እቲ -mid-20th ዘመን,Osamu Tezuka

"Presbyterian history is part of the history of Christianity, but the beginning of Presbyterianism as a distinct movement occurred during the 16th-century Protestant Reformation. As the Catholic Church resisted the reformers, several different theological movements splintered from the Church and bore different denominations. Presbyterianism was especially influenced by the French theologian John Calvin, who is credited with the development of Reformed theology, and the work of John Knox, a Scotsman who studied with Calvin in Geneva, Switzerland and brought his teachings back to Scotland.

"Gellius says that in his day humanitas is commonly used as a synonym for philanthropy – or kindness and benevolence toward one's fellow human being. Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean what we might call ""humane"" or ""polite"" learning, or the Greek equivalent Paideia. Gellius became a favorite author in the Italian Renaissance, and, in fifteenth-century Italy, teachers and scholars of philosophy, poetry, and rhetoric were called and called themselves ""humanists"". Modern scholars, however, point out that Cicero (106 – 43 BCE), who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term humanitas, in fact frequently used the word in both senses, as did his near contemporaries. For Cicero, a lawyer, what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech, which, allied to reason, could (and should) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law. Thus humanitas included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative, humanism, which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to scholarship.",166,Who argued that humanitas is wrong?,today,43,Gellius,two,3,"Gellius says እቲ አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ መዓልቲ humanitas እዩ commonly ዘገልገለ ከም ሓደ synonym ን philanthropy – ወይ ለዋሃነት እና benevolence ንቕድሚት 'one's ተኸታሊ ሰብ .ፍጥረት Gellius maintains እቲ እዚ ልሙድ usage እዩ ,ጌጋ እና እቲ መርኣያ writers ካብ ,Latin ከምዚ ከም Cicero እና ,others ዘገልገለ እቲ ቃል ጥራሕ ናብ ማለት እንታይ ንሕና ይኸዉን ደውል """"humane ወይ """"ክብሪ ብዘለዎ ,ምምሃር ወይ እቲ Greek ዝመዓራረ .Paideia Gellius ኮይኑ ሓደ ዝፍተው ጸሓፊ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Italian ,Renaissance ,እና አብ ውሽጢ -fifteenth-century ,Italy teachers እና scholars ካብ ,ፍልስፍና ,ግጥሚ እና rhetoric ኔሮም ዝተፀወዐ እና ዝተፀወዐ ባዕሎም """".humanists ዘበናዊ ,scholars ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ነጥቢ ደገ እቲ Cicero (106 – 43 ),BCE መን ኔሩ ብጥዕሚ ሓላፍነት ዝወስድ ን defining እና popularizing እቲ ቃል ,humanitas አብ ውሽጢ ሓቂ ብተደጋጋሚ ዘገልገለ እቲ ቃል አብ ውሽጢ ክልቲኡ ,senses ከም ግቡር ናቱ ጥቃ .contemporaries ን ,Cicero ሓደ ,ጠበቃ እንታይ ብጥዕሚ distinguished humans ካብ brutes ኔሩ ,ዘረባ ,አየናይ allied ናብ ,ምኽንያት ይከኣል (እና )ይሓይሽ ኣኽእል ንሶም ናብ ተስማዕመዐ disputes እና ንበር ብሓባር አብ ውሽጢ concord እና ስኒት ትሕቲ እቲ ስርዓት ካብ .ሕጊ ስለዝኾነ humanitas included ክልተ meanings ካብ እቲ outset እና እዚ ቀፃሊ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ዘበናዊ ,derivative ,humanism አየናይ ሙሉእ ሎምዓንቲ ይኽእል ምራሕ ናብ ክልቲኡ humanitarian benevolence እና ናብ .scholarship",መን argued እቲ humanitas እዩ ?ጌጋ,ሎምዓንቲ,43,Gellius,ክልተ

"U.S. President Barack Obama has rarely used the term, but in his inaugural address on 20 January 2009, he stated ""Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.""

Basic objectives of the Bush administration ""war on terror"", such as targeting al Qaeda and building international counterterrorism alliances, remain in place. In December 2012, Jeh Johnson, the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, stated that the military fight will be replaced by a law enforcement operation when speaking at Oxford University, predicting that al Qaeda will be so weakened to be ineffective, and has been ""effectively destroyed"", and thus the conflict will not be an armed conflict under international law.

"Napoléon Bonaparte (/nəˈpoʊliən, -ˈpoʊljən/; French: [napɔleɔ̃ bɔnapaʁt], born Napoleone di Buonaparte; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. Often considered one of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. He also remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political figures in Western history. In civil affairs, Napoleon had a major long-term impact by bringing liberal reforms to the territories that he conquered, especially the Low Countries, Switzerland, and large parts of modern Italy and Germany. He implemented fundamental liberal policies in France and throughout Western Europe.[note 1] His lasting legal achievement, the Napoleonic Code, has been adopted in various forms by a quarter of the world's legal systems, from Japan to Quebec.",189,What was Napoleon Bonaparte's military leader's birth name?,Japan,Napoleone di Buonaparte,Europe,Switzerland,2,"Napoléon Bonaparte (/,nəˈpoʊliən -/;ˈpoʊljən :French [napɔleɔ̃ ],bɔnapaʁt ተወሊዱ Napoleone di ;Buonaparte 15 ነሓሰ 1769 – 5 ተዝኸዉን )1821 ኔሩ ሓደ French ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት እና political መራሒ መን rose ናብ prominence አብ እዋን እቲ French ለውጢ እና መረሐ ቡዙሓት ዕውት campaigns አብ እዋን እቲ Revolutionary .Wars ከም Napoleon ,ኣነ ንሱ ኔሩ Emperor ካብ እቲ French ካብ 1804 ክሳብ ,1814 እና ካልኣይ አብ ውሽጢ .1815 Napoleon dominated European እና ዓለምለኻዊ affairs ን ቡዙሕ ካብ ሓደ ዓሰርተ ዓመት እስካብ leading France ተቃራኒ ሓደ ተኸታታሊ ካብ coalitions አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Napoleonic .Wars ንሱ ተዓወተ ብጥዕሚ ካብ እዚ wars እና እቲ ሰፊሕ መብዛሕትኡ ካብ ናቱ ,battles ምህናፅ ሓደ ገዚፍ empire እቲ ruled ልዕሊ continental Europe ቅድሚ ናቱ final ፈረሰ አብ ውሽጢ .1815 ኩል ግዘ ገምገመ ሓደ ካብ እቲ greatest commanders አብ ውሽጢ ,ታሪኽ ናቱ wars እና campaigns እዮም studied ኣብ ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት schools .worldwide ንሱ እውን remains ሓደ ካብ እቲ ብጥዕሚ celebrated እና ዘከራኽር political figures አብ ውሽጢ Western .ታሪኽ አብ ውሽጢ civil ,affairs Napoleon ዝነበረ ሓደ ዋና -long-term ፅልዋ ብ bringing liberal reforms ናብ እቲ territories እቲ ንሱ ,conquered ብፍላይ እቲ ውሑድ ,Countries ,Switzerland እና ገዚፍ parts ካብ ዘበናዊ Italy እና .Germany ንሱ implemented መሰረታዊ liberal policies አብ ውሽጢ France እና በቲ Western .[Europe.[note ]1 ናቱ lasting ሕጋዊ ,ዓወት እቲ Napoleonic ,Code ኣለዎ ዝነበረ adopted አብ ውሽጢ ዝተፈላለዩ forms ብ ሓደ ርብዒ ካብ እቲ 'world's ሕጋዊ ,systems ካብ Japan ናብ .Quebec",እንታይ ኔሩ Napoleon 'Bonaparte's ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት 'leader's birth ?ሽም,Japan,Napoleone di Buonaparte,Europe,Switzerland

"The first known European explorer to reach Bermuda was Spanish sea captain Juan de Bermúdez in 1503, after whom the islands are named. He claimed the apparently uninhabited islands for the Spanish Empire. Paying two visits to the archipelago, Bermúdez never landed on the islands, but did create a recognisable map of the archipelago. Shipwrecked Portuguese mariners are now thought to have been responsible for the 1543 inscription in Portuguese Rock (previously called Spanish Rock). Subsequent Spanish or other European parties are believed to have released pigs there, which had become feral and abundant on the island by the time European settlement began. In 1609, the English Virginia Company, which had established Jamestown in Virginia (a term originally applied to all of the North American continent) two years earlier, permanently settled Bermuda in the aftermath of a hurricane, when the crew and passengers of the Sea Venture steered the ship onto the surrounding reef to prevent its sinking, then landed ashore.",192,How many times did Bermdez visit the islands?,Juan de Bermúdez,Portuguese Rock,Bermúdez,two,4,"እቲ መጀመርታ ፍሉጥ European explorer ናብ ብፅሕ Bermuda ኔሩ ስጳኛ ባሕሪ captain Juan de Bermúdez አብ ውሽጢ ,1503 ድሕሪ መን እቲ islands እዮም .named ንሱ claimed እቲ እስካብ ዝፈልጦ uninhabited islands ን እቲ ስጳኛ .Empire Paying ክልተ visits ናብ እቲ ,archipelago Bermúdez ፍፁም landed አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ,islands ግን ግቡር ፍጠር ሓደ recognisable map ካብ እቲ .archipelago Shipwrecked Portuguese mariners እዮም ሕዚ ሓሳብ ናብ ኣለኒ ዝነበረ ሓላፍነት ዝወስድ ን እቲ 1543 inscription አብ ውሽጢ Portuguese ከውሒ (previously ዝተፀወዐ ስጳኛ ).ከውሒ Subsequent ስጳኛ ወይ ካልእ European parties እዮም believed ናብ ኣለኒ ተለቒቑ pigs ,ኣብቲ አየናይ ዝነበረ ምዃን feral እና ኣኺሉ ዝተረፈ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ደሴት ብ እቲ ግዜ European settlement .ጀሚሩ አብ ውሽጢ ,1609 እቲ ኢንግሊሽ Virginia ,ድርጅት አየናይ ዝነበረ ዝተመስረተ Jamestown አብ ውሽጢ Virginia (ሓደ ቃል originally applied ናብ ኩሎም ካብ እቲ ሰሜን American )ኣህጉር ክልተ ዓመታት ,ኣቕድም ኣቢሉ permanently settled Bermuda አብ ውሽጢ እቲ aftermath ካብ ሓደ ,ህቦብላ ንፋስ መዓዝ እቲ ጀምዓ እና passengers ካብ እቲ ባሕሪ ኣብ ሓደጋ ኣውደቐ steered እቲ መርከብ onto እቲ ከባቢ reef ናብ ምክልኻል ናቱ ,sinking ሽዑ landed .ashore",ከመይ ቡዙሕ times ግቡር Bermdez ጎብንይ እቲ ?islands,Juan de Bermúdez,Portuguese ከውሒ,Bermúdez,ክልተ

This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry, making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant.

"On the Origin of Species, published on 24 November 1859, is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.",196,On what date was On the Origin of Species published?,Beagle,Darwin,24 November 1859,the Origin of Species,3,"አብ ልዕሊ እቲ መሰረት ካብ ,ዓሌታት published አብ ልዕሊ 24 ሕዳር ,1859 እዩ ሓደ ስራሕ ካብ scientific ስነ ጽሑፍ ብ Charles Darwin አየናይ እዩ ገምገመ ናብ ኩን እቲ መሰረት ካብ evolutionary .biology 'Darwin's መፅሓፍ introduced እቲ scientific ሓሳብ እቲ populations መፂኡ ልዕሊ እቲ ዓይነት ትምህርቲ ካብ generations ብውሽጢ ሓደ ከይዲ ካብ ተፈጥራዊ .selection እቲ ነገር presented ሓደ ሰውነት ካብ ማስረጃ እቲ እቲ ፍልልይነት ካብ ህይወት arose ብ ልሙድ descent ብውሽጢ ሓደ branching ንድፊ ካብ .ደፋእታዊ ለውጢ Darwin included ማስረጃ እቲ ንሱ ዝነበረ gathered አብ ልዕሊ እቲ Beagle expedition አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 1830s እና ናቱ subsequent findings ካብ ,ፅንዓት ,correspondence እና .experimentation",አብ ልዕሊ እንታይ ዕለት ኔሩ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ መሰረት ካብ ዓሌታት ?published,Beagle,Darwin,24 ሕዳር 1859,እቲ መሰረት ካብ ዓሌታት

"The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.",199,What organ in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals serves as the center of the nervous system?,15–33 billion,several thousand,The brain,—,3,"እቲ ሓንጎል እዩ ሓደ organ እቲ serves ከም እቲ ማእኸል ካብ እቲ ድንጉፅ ስርዓት አብ ውሽጢ ኩሎም vertebrate እና ብጥዕሚ invertebrate .animals ጥራሕ ሓደ ቁሩብ invertebrates ከምዚ ከም ,sponges ,jellyfish adult ባሕሪ squirts እና starfish ግበር ዘይኮነ ኣለኒ ሓደ ;ሓንጎል diffuse ወይ localised nerve nets እዮም እዋናዊ .ከክንዲ እቲ ሓንጎል እዩ located አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ,ርእሲ ብልሙድ ዕፁው ናብ እቲ ቀዳማይ sensory organs ን ከምዚ senses ከም ,ራእይ ,hearing ,ሚዛን ,ጣዕሚ እና .ጨና እቲ ሓንጎል እዩ እቲ ብጥዕሚ ሕውስዋስ organ አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ 'vertebrate's .ሰውነት አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ዝተለመደ ,ሰብ እቲ cerebral cortex (እቲ largest )ክፋል እዩ ይግመት ናብ ይሕዝ 15–33 billion ,neurons ሕድሕድ connected ብ synapses ናብ ቡዙሓት ሽሕ ካልእ .neurons እዚ neurons ምርድዳእ ምስ ሓደ ካልእ ብ ማለት ካብ ነዊሕ protoplasmic fibers ዝተፀወዐ ,axons አየናይ ተሸከም trains ካብ signal pulses ዝተፀወዐ ተግባር potentials ናብ distant parts ካብ እቲ ሓንጎል ወይ ሰውነት targeting ዝተወሰነ recipient .cells",እንታይ organ አብ ውሽጢ ኩሎም vertebrate እና ብጥዕሚ invertebrate animals serves ከም እቲ ማእኸል ካብ እቲ ድንጉፅ ?ስርዓት,15–33 billion,ቡዙሓት ሽሕ,እቲ ሓንጎል,—

That month, Microsoft held an event for 400 developers in Bellevue, Washington to recruit support for the system. Also that month, Peter Moore, former president of Sega of America, joined Microsoft. On August 12, 2003, ATI signed on to produce the graphic processing unit for the new console, a deal which was publicly announced two days later.

"Baird Television Ltd. made Britain's first television broadcast, on 30 September 1929 from its studio in Long Acre, London, via the BBC's London transmitter, using the electromechanical system pioneered by John Logie Baird. This system used a vertically-scanned image of 30 lines – just enough resolution for a close-up of one person, and with a bandwidth low enough to use existing radio transmitters. Simultaneous transmission of sound and picture was achieved on 30 March 1930, by using the BBC's new twin transmitter at Brookmans Park. By late 1930, 30 minutes of morning programmes were broadcast Monday to Friday, and 30 minutes at midnight on Tuesdays and Fridays, after BBC radio went off the air.

Growing irritated with his subordinate position to Henry II and increasingly worried that John might be given additional lands and castles at his expense, Henry the Young King travelled to Paris and allied himself with Louis VII. Eleanor, irritated by her husband's persistent interference in Aquitaine, encouraged Richard and Geoffrey to join their brother Henry in Paris. Henry II triumphed over the coalition of his sons, but was generous to them in the peace settlement agreed at Montlouis.

"In August 1836, two real estate entrepreneurs—Augustus Chapman Allen and John Kirby Allen—from New York, purchased 6,642 acres (26.88 km2) of land along Buffalo Bayou with the intent of founding a city. The Allen brothers decided to name the city after Sam Houston, the popular general at the Battle of San Jacinto, who was elected President of Texas in September 1836. The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but there were slave dealers in Houston. Thousands of enslaved African-Americans lived near the city before the Civil War. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs. In 1860 forty-nine percent of the city's population was enslaved. A few slaves, perhaps as many as 2,000 between 1835 and 1865, came through the illegal African trade. Post-war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state. They also brought or purchased enslaved African Americans, whose numbers nearly tripled in the state from 1850 to 1860, from 58,000 to 182,566.",208,What did the Allen brothers name their new city after?,"as many as 2,000",Sam Houston,26.88,Thousands,2,"አብ ውሽጢ ነሓሰ ,1836 ክልተ ሓቂ ንብረት entrepreneurs—Augustus Chapman Allen እና John Kirby Allen—from ሓድሽ ,York purchased ,6,642 acres (.26.88 )km2 ካብ መሬት ማዕረ ኣንፈት Buffalo Bayou ምስ እቲ intent ካብ founding ሓደ .ከተማ እቲ Allen brothers ወሲነ ናብ ሽም እቲ ከተማ ድሕሪ Sam ,Houston እቲ ህቡብ ሓፈሻዊ ኣብ እቲ ውግእ ካብ San ,Jacinto መን ኔሩ elected ፕረዝደንት ካብ Texas አብ ውሽጢ መስከረም .1836 እቲ ምዑዝ መብዛሕትኡ ካብ slaves አብ ውሽጢ Texas መጺኡ ምስ ናቶም owners ካብ እቲ older ባርያ .states Sizable ,numbers ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ መጺኡ ብውሽጢ እቲ ዘቤት ባርያ .ንግዲ ሓድሽ Orleans ኔሩ እቲ ማእኸል ካብ እዚ ንግዲ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ጥሉቅ ,ደቡብ ግን ኣብቲ ኔሮም ባርያ dealers አብ ውሽጢ .Houston Thousands ካብ enslaved -African-Americans lived ጥቃ እቲ ከተማ ቅድሚ እቲ Civil .ውግእ ቡዙሕ ካብ ንሶም ጥቃ እቲ ከተማ worked አብ ልዕሊ ሽኮር እና ጡጥ ,plantations እስካብ ብጥዕሚ ካብ እቲኦም አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ከተማ limits ዝነበረ ዘቤት እና artisan .jobs አብ ውሽጢ 1860 -forty-nine percent ካብ እቲ 'city's በዝሒ ህዝቢ ኔሩ .enslaved ሓደ ቁሩብ ,slaves ምናልባት ከም ቡዙሕ ከም ,2,000 አብ መንጎ 1835 እና ,1865 መጺኡ ብውሽጢ እቲ ዘይሕጋዊ African .ንግዲ -Post-war Texas grew ብቕልጡፍ ከም migrants poured ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ ጡጥ lands ካብ እቲ .ግዝኣት ንሶም እውን ምምፃእ ወይ purchased enslaved African ,Americans ናይ መን numbers ከባቢ tripled አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ግዝኣት ካብ 1850 ናብ ,1860 ካብ ,58,000 ናብ ,.182,566",እንታይ ግቡር እቲ Allen brothers ሽም ናቶም ሓድሽ ከተማ ?ድሕሪ,"ከም ቡዙሕ ከም ,2,000",Sam Houston,.26.88,Thousands
"The discovery and isolation of radium in uranium ore (pitchblende) by Marie Curie sparked the development of uranium mining to extract the radium, which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials. This left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product, since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium. This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry, making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant.

Nevertheless, it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world. In addition to being the birthplace of the Red Cross, Switzerland is home to numerous international organizations, including the second largest UN office.

"Unlike the Spanish milled dollar the U.S. dollar is based upon a decimal system of values. In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol ₥), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol ¢), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; ""dime"" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10¢, while ""eagle"" and ""mill"" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599⁄10. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, ""paper money"" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the ""double eagle"", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as ""fractional currency"", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as ""shinplasters"". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a ""Union"", ""Half Union"", and ""Quarter Union"", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100.",212,What is the currency based upon a decimal system of values?,less than a dollar,U.S.,100,1792,2,"Unlike እቲ ስጳኛ milled dollar እቲ ..U.S dollar እዩ መሰረት ዝገበረ ኣብ ግዘ ሓደ decimal ስርዓት ካብ .values አብ ውሽጢ ተወሳኺ ናብ እቲ dollar እቲ coinage ፍፃመ officially ዝተመስረተ monetary units ካብ mill ወይ -one-thousandth ካብ ሓደ dollar (ምልክት ),₥ cent ወይ -one-hundredth ካብ ሓደ dollar (ምልክት ),¢ dime ወይ -one-tenth ካብ ሓደ ,dollar እና ኣሞራ ወይ ዓሰርተ ,dollars ምስ prescribed weights እና ሕዋስ ካብ ,ወርቂ ,ነሓስ ወይ ነሓስ ን .ሕድሕድ እቲ ነገር ኔሩ proposed አብ ውሽጢ እቲ -mid-1800s እቲ ሓደ ሚእቲ dollars ኩን ፍሉጥ ከም ሓደ ,union ግን አይኮንን union coins ኔሮም ብስሩ ወቐዐ እና ጥራሕ patterns ን እቲ $50 ፍርቂ union .ምህላው ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ጥራሕ cents እዮም አብ ውሽጢ everyday ጥቅሚ ከም divisions ካብ እቲ ;dollar """"dime እዩ ዘገልገለ solely ከም እቲ ሽም ካብ እቲ coin ምስ እቲ ዋጋ ካብ ,10¢ እስካብ """"ኣሞራ እና """"mill እዮም largely ዘይፍለጥ ናብ እቲ ሓፈሻዊ ,ህዝባዊ እኳ mills እዮም ሓደ ሓደ ግዘ ዘገልገለ አብ ውሽጢ matters ካብ tax ,levies እና gasoline prices እዮም ብልሙድ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ፎርም ካብ $.X.XX9 per ,gallon ..,e.g $.,3.599 ሓደ ሓደ ግዘ ዝተፀሓፈ ከም $..3.599⁄10 መዓዝ አብዚ ሕዚ issued አብ ውሽጢ circulating ,ፎርም denominations ማዕረ ናብ ወይ ዝወሓደ ካብ ሓደ dollar እዮም emitted ከም ..U.S coins እስካብ denominations ማዕረ ናብ ወይ greater ካብ ሓደ dollar እዮም emitted ከም Federal ምቕማጥ notes (ምስ እቲ ዝተፈለየ ካብ ,ወርቂ ነሓስ እና platinum coins valued ሓፍ ናብ $100 ከም ሕጋዊ ,ለውሃት ግን ዋጋ ርሑቅ ቡዙሕ ከም ).bullion ክልቲኡ -one-dollar coins እና notes እዮም produced ,ሎምዓንቲ ዋላ እኳ እቲ መዝገብ ፎርም እዩ significantly ቡዙሕ .ልሙድ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ,ሕሉፍ ""ወረቐት ""ገንዘብ ኔሩ ሕልፍ ሕልፍ ኢሉ issued አብ ውሽጢ denominations ዝወሓደ ካብ ሓደ dollar (fractional )ገንዘብ እና ወርቂ coins ኔሮም issued ን circulation ሓፍ ናብ እቲ ዋጋ ካብ $20 (ፍሉጥ ከም እቲ ""ዕፅፊ "",ኣሞራ discontinued አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ).1930s እቲ ቃል ኣሞራ ኔሩ ዘገልገለ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Coinage ፍፃመ ካብ 1792 ን እቲ denomination ካብ ዓሰርተ ,dollars እና subsequently ኔሩ ዘገልገለ አብ ውሽጢ naming ወርቂ .coins ወረቐት ገንዘብ ዝወሓደ ካብ ሓደ dollar አብ ውሽጢ ,denomination ፍሉጥ ከም ""fractional "",ገንዘብ ኔሩ እውን ሓደ ሓደ ግዘ pejoratively referred ናብ ከም """".shinplasters አብ ውሽጢ ,1854 James ,Guthrie ሽዑ Secretary ካብ እቲ ,Treasury proposed creating $,100 $50 እና $25 ወርቂ ,coins አየናይ ኔሮም referred ናብ ከም ሓደ """",Union ""ፍርቂ "",Union እና ""ርብዒ "",Union ስለዝኾነ implying ሓደ denomination ካብ 1 Union = $.100",እንታይ እዩ እቲ ገንዘብ መሰረት ዝገበረ ኣብ ግዘ ሓደ decimal ስርዓት ካብ ?values,ዝወሓደ ካብ ሓደ dollar,..U.S,100,1792
"Chinese political philosophy dates back to the Spring and Autumn Period, specifically with Confucius in the 6th century BC. Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States period. The major philosophies during the period, Confucianism, Legalism, Mohism, Agrarianism and Taoism, each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as Confucius, Mencius, and Mozi, focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, meritocratic government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and laws. Mohism advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on frugality and ascetism.

The minutes of the meetings of Burke's Club remain in the collection of the Historical Society. Burke graduated from Trinity in 1748.

These quickly supplanted the earlier steam driven elevators: exploiting Pascal's law, they provided a much greater force. A water pump supplied a variable level of water pressure to a plunger encased inside a vertical cylinder, allowing the level of the platform (carrying a heavy load) to be raised and lowered.

"The domestication of poultry took place several thousand years ago. This may have originally been as a result of people hatching and rearing young birds from eggs collected from the wild, but later involved keeping the birds permanently in captivity. Domesticated chickens may have been used for cockfighting at first and quail kept for their songs, but soon it was realised how useful it was having a captive-bred source of food. Selective breeding for fast growth, egg-laying ability, conformation, plumage and docility took place over the centuries, and modern breeds often look very different from their wild ancestors. Although some birds are still kept in small flocks in extensive systems, most birds available in the market today are reared in intensive commercial enterprises. Poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat globally and, along with eggs, provides nutritionally beneficial food containing high-quality protein accompanied by a low proportion of fat. All poultry meat should be properly handled and sufficiently cooked in order to reduce the risk of food poisoning.",220,When did domestication of poultry take place?,several thousand years ago,first,today,second,1,"እቲ domestication ካብ poultry ምውሳድ ቦታ ቡዙሓት ሽሕ ዓመታት .ቕድሚ እዚ ተዝኸዉን ኣለኒ originally ዝነበረ ከም ሓደ ውፅኢት ካብ ህዝቢ hatching እና rearing ንእሽተይ birds ካብ eggs collected ካብ እቲ ,ልቂ ግን ዳሕራይ ዝተኻተተ keeping እቲ birds permanently አብ ውሽጢ .captivity Domesticated chickens ተዝኸዉን ኣለኒ ዝነበረ ዘገልገለ ን cockfighting ኣብ መጀመርታ እና quail ዝተዓቀበ ን ናቶም ,songs ግን አብ ቀረባ እቲ ነገር ኔሩ realised ከመይ ጠቃሚ እቲ ነገር ኔሩ ምህላው ሓደ -captive-bred ፍልፍል ካብ .ምግቢ Selective breeding ን ቅልጡፍ ,ዕቤት -egg-laying ,ተኽእሎ ,conformation plumage እና docility ምውሳድ ቦታ ልዕሊ እቲ ,centuries እና ዘበናዊ breeds ኩል ግዘ ረአ ብጣዕሚ ፍሉይ ካብ ናቶም ልቂ .ዓሌት ዋላ እኳ ንእሽተይ birds እዮም እስካብ ሕዚ ዝተዓቀበ አብ ውሽጢ ንኡስ flocks አብ ውሽጢ extensive ,systems ብጥዕሚ birds ቅሩብ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ዕዳጋ ሎምዓንቲ እዮም reared አብ ውሽጢ intensive ንግዳዊ .enterprises Poultry እዩ እቲ ካልኣይ ብጥዕሚ widely eaten ዓይነት ካብ ስጋ globally ,እና ማዕረ ኣንፈት ምስ ,eggs provides nutritionally beneficial ምግቢ containing -high-quality protein accompanied ብ ሓደ ውሑድ proportion ካብ .ረጒድ ኩሎም poultry ስጋ ይሓይሽ ኩን ብግቡእ handled እና sufficiently cooked አብ ውሽጢ ስርዓት ናብ ቀንስ እቲ ሓደጋ ካብ ምግቢ .poisoning",መዓዝ ግቡር domestication ካብ poultry ውሰድ ?ቦታ,ቡዙሓት ሽሕ ዓመታት ቕድሚ,መጀመርታ,ሎምዓንቲ,ካልኣይ

"The term ""great power"" was first used to represent the most important powers in Europe during the post-Napoleonic era. The ""Great Powers"" constituted the ""Concert of Europe"" and claimed the right to joint enforcement of the postwar treaties. The formalization of the division between small powers and great powers came about with the signing of the Treaty of Chaumont in 1814. Since then, the international balance of power has shifted numerous times, most dramatically during World War I and World War II. While some nations are widely considered to be great powers, there is no definitive list of them. In literature, alternative terms for great power are often world power or major power, but these terms can also be interchangeable with superpower.",228,What was the term used to represent the most important powers in Europe during the post Napoleonic era?,—,Europe,"The ""Great Powers",1814,3,"እቲ ቃል ""ምዑዝ ""ሓይሊ ኔሩ መጀመርታ ዘገልገለ ናብ ውክልና እቲ ብጥዕሚ ጠቃሚ powers አብ ውሽጢ Europe አብ እዋን እቲ -post-Napoleonic .era እቲ ""ምዑዝ ""Powers constituted እቲ ""ምርኢት ካብ ""Europe እና claimed እቲ ትኽክል ናብ መጋጥም enforcement ካብ እቲ postwar .treaties እቲ formalization ካብ እቲ division አብ መንጎ ንኡስ powers እና ምዑዝ powers መጺኡ ብዝዕባ ምስ እቲ signing ካብ እቲ Treaty ካብ Chaumont አብ ውሽጢ .1814 ካብ ,ሽዑ እቲ ዓለም ለኻዊ ሚዛን ካብ ሓይሊ ኣለዎ shifted numerous ,times ብጥዕሚ dramatically አብ እዋን ዓለም ውግእ ኣነ እና ዓለም ውግእ .II እስካብ ንእሽተይ nations እዮም widely ገምገመ ናብ ኩን ምዑዝ ,powers ኣብቲ እዩ አይኮንን definitive ዝርዝር ካብ .ንሶም አብ ውሽጢ ,ስነ ጽሑፍ ኣማራፂ ስያመታት ን ምዑዝ ሓይሊ እዮም ኩል ግዘ ዓለም ሓይሊ ወይ ዋና ,ሓይሊ ግን እዚ ስያመታት ይኽእል እውን ኩን interchangeable ምስ .superpower",እንታይ ኔሩ እቲ ቃል ዘገልገለ ናብ ውክልና እቲ ብጥዕሚ ጠቃሚ powers አብ ውሽጢ Europe አብ እዋን እቲ ለጥፍ Napoleonic ?era,—,Europe,"እቲ ""ምዑዝ Powers",1814
"While attending Ealing Art College, Tim Staffell became friends with Farrokh Bulsara, a fellow student who had assumed the English name of Freddie. Bulsara felt that he and the band had the same tastes and soon became a keen fan of Smile. In late 1970, after Staffell left to join the band Humpy Bong, the remaining Smile members, encouraged by Bulsara, changed their name to ""Queen"" and continued working together. When asked about the name, Bulsara explained, ""I thought up the name Queen. It's just a name, but it's very regal obviously, and it sounds splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. It had a lot of visual potential and was open to all sorts of interpretations.

"The first known European explorer to reach Bermuda was Spanish sea captain Juan de Bermúdez in 1503, after whom the islands are named. He claimed the apparently uninhabited islands for the Spanish Empire. Paying two visits to the archipelago, Bermúdez never landed on the islands, but did create a recognisable map of the archipelago. Shipwrecked Portuguese mariners are now thought to have been responsible for the 1543 inscription in Portuguese Rock (previously called Spanish Rock). Subsequent Spanish or other European parties are believed to have released pigs there, which had become feral and abundant on the island by the time European settlement began.

"The Crimean War was a military conflict fought between October 1853 – March 1856 in which Russia lost to an alliance of France, the United Kingdom, the Ottoman Empire, and Sardinia. The immediate cause involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land, which was controlled by the Ottoman Empire. The French promoted the rights of Catholics, while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Christians. The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of the United Kingdom and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at Ottoman expense. It has widely been noted that the causes, in one case involving an argument over a key, have never revealed a ""greater confusion of purpose"", yet led to a war noted for its ""notoriously incompetent international butchery.""",238,When was the Crimean War fought?,March 1856,Christians,Eastern Orthodox,Christian,1,"እቲ Crimean ውግእ ኔሩ ሓደ ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት ባእሲ ተባኣሰ አብ መንጎ ጥቅምቲ 1853 – መጋቢት 1856 አብ ውሽጢ አየናይ Russia ዝጠፈአ ናብ ሓደ alliance ካብ ,France እቲ United ,Kingdom እቲ Ottoman ,Empire እና .Sardinia እቲ ሽዕ ንሻዕ ጠንቂ ዝተኻተተ እቲ rights ካብ Christian minorities አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Holy ,መሬት አየናይ ኔሩ controlled ብ እቲ Ottoman .Empire እቲ French promoted እቲ rights ካብ ,Catholics እስካብ Russia promoted እቲኦም ካብ እቲ Eastern Orthodox .Christians እቲ -longer-term causes ዝተኻተተ እቲ ኣውድቅ ካብ እቲ Ottoman Empire እና እቲ unwillingness ካብ እቲ United Kingdom እና France ናብ ፍቀድ Russia ናብ ርኸብ ግዝኣት እና ሓይሊ ኣብ Ottoman .expense እቲ ነገር ኣለዎ widely ዝነበረ ተመዝጊቡ እቲ እቲ ,causes አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ጉዳይ involving ሓደ ክትዕ ልዕሊ ሓደ ,መፍትሕ ኣለኒ ፍፁም ዝተቓልዐ ሓደ ""greater ምድንጋራት ካብ "",ዕላማ እስካብ ዛሕዚ መረሐ ናብ ሓደ ውግእ ተመዝጊቡ ን ናቱ ""notoriously incompetent ዓለም ለኻዊ .""butchery",መዓዝ ኔሩ እቲ Crimean ውግእ ?ተባኣሰ,መጋቢት 1856,Christians,Eastern Orthodox,Christian
"In philosophy, idealism is the group of philosophies which assert that reality, or reality as we can know it, is fundamentally mental, mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial. Epistemologically, idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In a sociological sense, idealism emphasizes how human ideas—especially beliefs and values—shape society. As an ontological doctrine, idealism goes further, asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit. Idealism thus rejects physicalist and dualist theories that fail to ascribe priority to the mind.",239,What sense does idealism have?,—,—,a sociological sense,—,3,"አብ ውሽጢ ,ፍልስፍና idealism እዩ እቲ ጉጅለ ካብ philosophies አየናይ assert እቲ ,ክውንነት ወይ ክውንነት ከም ንሕና ይኽእል ፍለጥ ,እቲ ነገር እዩ fundamentally ,ስነ ኣእምሮኣዊ mentally ,constructed ወይ ተዘይኮይኑ ግን .immaterial ,Epistemologically idealism manifests ከም ሓደ skepticism ብዝዕባ እቲ possibility ካብ knowing ዝኾነ -mind-independent .ነገር አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ sociological ,ትርጉም idealism emphasizes ከመይ ሰብ ideas—especially beliefs እና values—shape .ሕብረተሰብ ከም ሓደ ontological ,doctrine idealism ይኸድ ,ርሑቅ asserting እቲ ኩሎም entities እዮም composed ካብ ሓንጎል ወይ .መንፈስ Idealism ስለዝኾነ rejects physicalist እና dualist theories እቲ ምውዳቕ ናብ ascribe ቀዳምነት ናብ እቲ .ሓንጎል",እንታይ ትርጉም ምግባር idealism ?ኣለኒ,—,—,ሓደ sociological ትርጉም,—
"In August 1836, two real estate entrepreneurs—Augustus Chapman Allen and John Kirby Allen—from New York, purchased 6,642 acres (26.88 km2) of land along Buffalo Bayou with the intent of founding a city. The Allen brothers decided to name the city after Sam Houston, the popular general at the Battle of San Jacinto, who was elected President of Texas in September 1836. The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but there were slave dealers in Houston. Thousands of enslaved African-Americans lived near the city before the Civil War. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs. In 1860 forty-nine percent of the city's population was enslaved. A few slaves, perhaps as many as 2,000 between 1835 and 1865, came through the illegal African trade. Post-war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state. They also brought or purchased enslaved African Americans, whose numbers nearly tripled in the state from 1850 to 1860, from 58,000 to 182,566.",240,How large was the purchase of land by two men in August 1836?,August 1836,the Battle of San Jacinto,"6,642 acres",Thousands,3,"አብ ውሽጢ ነሓሰ ,1836 ክልተ ሓቂ ንብረት entrepreneurs—Augustus Chapman Allen እና John Kirby Allen—from ሓድሽ ,York purchased ,6,642 acres (.26.88 )km2 ካብ መሬት ማዕረ ኣንፈት Buffalo Bayou ምስ እቲ intent ካብ founding ሓደ .ከተማ እቲ Allen brothers ወሲነ ናብ ሽም እቲ ከተማ ድሕሪ Sam ,Houston እቲ ህቡብ ሓፈሻዊ ኣብ እቲ ውግእ ካብ San ,Jacinto መን ኔሩ elected ፕረዝደንት ካብ Texas አብ ውሽጢ መስከረም .1836 እቲ ምዑዝ መብዛሕትኡ ካብ slaves አብ ውሽጢ Texas መጺኡ ምስ ናቶም owners ካብ እቲ older ባርያ .states Sizable ,numbers ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ መጺኡ ብውሽጢ እቲ ዘቤት ባርያ .ንግዲ ሓድሽ Orleans ኔሩ እቲ ማእኸል ካብ እዚ ንግዲ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ጥሉቅ ,ደቡብ ግን ኣብቲ ኔሮም ባርያ dealers አብ ውሽጢ .Houston Thousands ካብ enslaved -African-Americans lived ጥቃ እቲ ከተማ ቅድሚ እቲ Civil .ውግእ ቡዙሕ ካብ ንሶም ጥቃ እቲ ከተማ worked አብ ልዕሊ ሽኮር እና ጡጥ ,plantations እስካብ ብጥዕሚ ካብ እቲኦም አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ከተማ limits ዝነበረ ዘቤት እና artisan .jobs አብ ውሽጢ 1860 -forty-nine percent ካብ እቲ 'city's በዝሒ ህዝቢ ኔሩ .enslaved ሓደ ቁሩብ ,slaves ምናልባት ከም ቡዙሕ ከም ,2,000 አብ መንጎ 1835 እና ,1865 መጺኡ ብውሽጢ እቲ ዘይሕጋዊ African .ንግዲ -Post-war Texas grew ብቕልጡፍ ከም migrants poured ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ ጡጥ lands ካብ እቲ .ግዝኣት ንሶም እውን ምምፃእ ወይ purchased enslaved African ,Americans ናይ መን numbers ከባቢ tripled አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ግዝኣት ካብ 1850 ናብ ,1860 ካብ ,58,000 ናብ ,.182,566",ከመይ ገዚፍ ኔሩ እቲ ዓድግ ካብ መሬት ብ ክልተ men አብ ውሽጢ ነሓሰ ?1836,ነሓሰ 1836,እቲ ውግእ ካብ San Jacinto,",6,642 acres",Thousands

"A fleet carrier is intended to operate with the main fleet and usually provides an offensive capability. These are the largest carriers capable of fast speeds. By comparison, escort carriers were developed to provide defense for convoys of ships. They were smaller and slower with lower numbers of aircraft carried. Most were built from mercantile hulls or, in the case of merchant aircraft carriers, were bulk cargo ships with a flight deck added on top. Light aircraft carriers were carriers that were fast enough to operate with the fleet but of smaller size with reduced aircraft capacity.

Most significantly, respondents were given the option of selecting one or more race categories to indicate racial identities. Data show that nearly seven million Americans identified as members of two or more races.

"First recognized in 1900 by Max Planck, it was originally the proportionality constant between the minimal increment of energy, E, of a hypothetical electrically charged oscillator in a cavity that contained black body radiation, and the frequency, f, of its associated electromagnetic wave. In 1905 the value E, the minimal energy increment of a hypothetical oscillator, was theoretically associated by Einstein with a ""quantum"" or minimal element of the energy of the electromagnetic wave itself. The light quantum behaved in some respects as an electrically neutral particle, as opposed to an electromagnetic wave.

"Gellius says that in his day humanitas is commonly used as a synonym for philanthropy – or kindness and benevolence toward one's fellow human being. Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean what we might call ""humane"" or ""polite"" learning, or the Greek equivalent Paideia. Gellius became a favorite author in the Italian Renaissance, and, in fifteenth-century Italy, teachers and scholars of philosophy, poetry, and rhetoric were called and called themselves ""humanists"". Modern scholars, however, point out that Cicero (106 – 43 BCE), who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term humanitas, in fact frequently used the word in both senses, as did his near contemporaries. For Cicero, a lawyer, what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech, which, allied to reason, could (and should) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law. Thus humanitas included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative, humanism, which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to scholarship.",256,Who said humanitas is a synonym for philanthropy?,two,today,43,Gellius,4,"Gellius says እቲ አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ መዓልቲ humanitas እዩ commonly ዘገልገለ ከም ሓደ synonym ን philanthropy – ወይ ለዋሃነት እና benevolence ንቕድሚት 'one's ተኸታሊ ሰብ .ፍጥረት Gellius maintains እቲ እዚ ልሙድ usage እዩ ,ጌጋ እና እቲ መርኣያ writers ካብ ,Latin ከምዚ ከም Cicero እና ,others ዘገልገለ እቲ ቃል ጥራሕ ናብ ማለት እንታይ ንሕና ይኸዉን ደውል """"humane ወይ """"ክብሪ ብዘለዎ ,ምምሃር ወይ እቲ Greek ዝመዓራረ .Paideia Gellius ኮይኑ ሓደ ዝፍተው ጸሓፊ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Italian ,Renaissance ,እና አብ ውሽጢ -fifteenth-century ,Italy teachers እና scholars ካብ ,ፍልስፍና ,ግጥሚ እና rhetoric ኔሮም ዝተፀወዐ እና ዝተፀወዐ ባዕሎም """".humanists ዘበናዊ ,scholars ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ነጥቢ ደገ እቲ Cicero (106 – 43 ),BCE መን ኔሩ ብጥዕሚ ሓላፍነት ዝወስድ ን defining እና popularizing እቲ ቃል ,humanitas አብ ውሽጢ ሓቂ ብተደጋጋሚ ዘገልገለ እቲ ቃል አብ ውሽጢ ክልቲኡ ,senses ከም ግቡር ናቱ ጥቃ .contemporaries ን ,Cicero ሓደ ,ጠበቃ እንታይ ብጥዕሚ distinguished humans ካብ brutes ኔሩ ,ዘረባ ,አየናይ allied ናብ ,ምኽንያት ይከኣል (እና )ይሓይሽ ኣኽእል ንሶም ናብ ተስማዕመዐ disputes እና ንበር ብሓባር አብ ውሽጢ concord እና ስኒት ትሕቲ እቲ ስርዓት ካብ .ሕጊ ስለዝኾነ humanitas included ክልተ meanings ካብ እቲ outset እና እዚ ቀፃሊ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ዘበናዊ ,derivative ,humanism አየናይ ሙሉእ ሎምዓንቲ ይኽእል ምራሕ ናብ ክልቲኡ humanitarian benevolence እና ናብ .scholarship",መን ኢሉ humanitas እዩ ሓደ synonym ን ?philanthropy,ክልተ,ሎምዓንቲ,43,Gellius

It is not, however, the oldest surviving English settlement in North America or Canada, having been preceded by the Cuper's Cove colony at Cupids, founded in 1610, and the Bristol's Hope colony at Harbour Grace, founded in 1618. In fact, although English fishermen had begun setting up seasonal camps in Newfoundland in the 16th Century, they were expressly forbidden by the British government, at the urging of the West Country fishing industry, from establishing permanent settlements along the English controlled coast, hence the town of St. John's was not established as a permanent community until after the 1630s at the earliest.

"The baptism of Jesus and his crucifixion are considered to be two historically certain facts about Jesus. James Dunn states that these ""two facts in the life of Jesus command almost universal assent"" and ""rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny' scale of historical facts"" that they are often the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus. Bart Ehrman states that the crucifixion of Jesus on the orders of Pontius Pilate is the most certain element about him. John Dominic Crossan states that the crucifixion of Jesus is as certain as any historical fact can be.

"In 1636 George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, ruler of the Brunswick-Lüneburg principality of Calenberg, moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692, and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its electors would later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who ruled in Hanover was William IV. Semi-Salic law, which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.

"Jews originated as a national and religious group in the Middle East during the second millennium BCE, in the part of the Levant known as the Land of Israel. The Merneptah Stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel, associated with the god El, somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE. The Israelites, as an outgrowth of the Canaanite population, consolidated their hold with the emergence of the Kingdom of Israel, and the Kingdom of Judah. Some consider that these Canaanite sedentary Israelites melded with incoming nomadic groups known as 'Hebrews'. Though few sources in the Bible mention the exilic periods in detail, the experience of diaspora life, from the Ancient Egyptian rule over the Levant, to Assyrian Captivity and Exile, to Babylonian Captivity and Exile, to Seleucid Imperial rule, to the Roman occupation, and the historical relations between Israelites and the homeland, became a major feature of Jewish history, identity and memory.",266,Where did Jews originate as a national and religious group during the second millennium BCE?,second,Hebrews,the Middle East,Ancient,3,"Jews originated ከም ሓደ ሃገራዊ እና ሃይማኖታዊ ጉጅለ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ማእኸል ምብራቅ አብ እዋን እቲ ካልኣይ millennium ,BCE አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ክፋል ካብ እቲ Levant ፍሉጥ ከም እቲ መሬት ካብ .Israel እቲ Merneptah Stele appears ናብ ኣረጋግፅ እቲ ህላወ ካብ ሓደ ህዝቢ ካብ ,Israel ተሓባበረ ምስ እቲ ፈጣሪ ,El somewhere አብ ውሽጢ Canaan ከም ርሑቅ ዝባን ከም እቲ 13th ዘመን .BCE እቲ ,Israelites ከም ሓደ outgrowth ካብ እቲ Canaanite ,በዝሒ ህዝቢ consolidated ናቶም ሓዝ ምስ እቲ emergence ካብ እቲ Kingdom ካብ ,Israel እና እቲ Kingdom ካብ .Judah ንእሽተይ ሕሰበሉ እቲ እዚ Canaanite sedentary Israelites melded ምስ incoming nomadic groups ፍሉጥ ከም ''.Hebrews እኳ ቁሩብ sources አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Bible ጥቀስ እቲ exilic periods አብ ውሽጢ ,ዝርዝር እቲ ተሞክሮ ካብ diaspora ,ህይወት ካብ እቲ ጥንታዊ Egyptian ስርዓት ልዕሊ እቲ ,Levant ናብ Assyrian Captivity እና ,Exile ናብ Babylonian Captivity እና ,Exile ናብ Seleucid Imperial ,ስርዓት ናብ እቲ Roman ,ሞያ እና እቲ historical relations አብ መንጎ Israelites እና እቲ ,homeland ኮይኑ ሓደ ዋና መለለዩ ካብ Jewish ,ታሪኽ መንነት እና .ተዘክሮ",አበይ ግቡር Jews originate ከም ሓደ ሃገራዊ እና ሃይማኖታዊ ጉጅለ አብ እዋን እቲ ካልኣይ millennium ?BCE,ካልኣይ,Hebrews,እቲ ማእኸል ምብራቅ,ጥንታዊ

"The English word scientist is relatively recent—first coined by William Whewell in the 19th century. Previously, people investigating nature called themselves natural philosophers. While empirical investigations of the natural world have been described since classical antiquity (for example, by Thales, Aristotle, and others), and scientific methods have been employed since the Middle Ages (for example, by Ibn al-Haytham, and Roger Bacon), the dawn of modern science is often traced back to the early modern period and in particular to the scientific revolution that took place in 16th- and 17th-century Europe. Scientific methods are considered to be so fundamental to modern science that some consider earlier inquiries into nature to be pre-scientific.

"Weinreich's identity variant similarly includes the categories of identity diffusion, foreclosure and crisis, but with a somewhat different emphasis. Here, with respect to identity diffusion for example, an optimal level is interpreted as the norm, as it is unrealistic to expect an individual to resolve all their conflicted identifications with others; therefore we should be alert to individuals with levels which are much higher or lower than the norm – highly diffused individuals are classified as diffused, and those with low levels as foreclosed or defensive. (Weinreich & Saunderson, 2003, pp 65–67; 105-106). Weinreich applies the identity variant in a framework which also allows for the transition from one to another by way of biographical experiences and resolution of conflicted identifications situated in various contexts – for example, an adolescent going through family break-up may be in one state, whereas later in a stable marriage with a secure professional role may be in another. Hence, though there is continuity, there is also development and change.

"Incandescent bulbs are much less efficient than most other types of electric lighting; incandescent bulbs convert less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light, with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2%. The remaining energy is converted into heat. The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb is 16 lumens per watt, compared with 60 lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150 lm/W for some white LED lamps. Some applications of the incandescent bulb deliberately use the heat generated by the filament. Such applications include incubators, brooding boxes for poultry, heat lights for reptile tanks, infrared heating for industrial heating and drying processes, lava lamps, and the Easy-Bake Oven toy.

Pope John XXIII surprised those who expected him to be a caretaker pope by calling the historic Second Vatican Council (1962–65), the first session opening on 11 October 1962. His passionate views on equality were summed up in his famous statement, ""We were all made in God's image, and thus, we are all Godly alike.""

"Josip Broz Tito (Cyrillic: Јосип Броз Тито, pronounced [jǒsip brôːz tîto]; born Josip Broz; 7 May 1892[nb 1] – 4 May 1980) was a Yugoslav revolutionary and statesman, serving in various roles from 1943 until his death in 1980. During World War II he was the leader of the Partisans, often regarded as the most effective resistance movement in occupied Europe. While his presidency has been criticized as authoritarian, and concerns about the repression of political opponents have been raised, Tito was ""seen by most as a benevolent dictator"" due to his economic and diplomatic policies. He was a popular public figure both in Yugoslavia and abroad. Viewed as a unifying symbol, his internal policies maintained the peaceful coexistence of the nations of the Yugoslav federation.

"The city's charter was granted by Prince John, as Lord of Ireland, in 1185. The city was once fully walled, and some wall sections and gates remain today. For much of the Middle Ages, Cork city was an outpost of Old English culture in the midst of a predominantly hostile Gaelic countryside and cut off from the English government in the Pale around Dublin. Neighbouring Gaelic and Hiberno-Norman lords extorted ""Black Rent"" from the citizens to keep them from attacking the city. The present extent of the city has exceeded the medieval boundaries of the Barony of Cork City; it now takes in much of the neighbouring Barony of Cork.

"The phonograph disc record was the primary medium used for music reproduction until late in the 20th century, replacing the phonograph cylinder record–with which it had co-existed from the late 1880s through to the 1920s–by the late 1920s. Records retained the largest market share even when new formats such as compact cassette were mass-marketed. By the late 1980s, digital media, in the form of the compact disc, had gained a larger market share, and the vinyl record left the mainstream in 1991. From the 1990s to the 2010s, records continued to be manufactured and sold on a much smaller scale, and were especially used by disc jockeys (DJ)s, released by artists in some genres, and listened to by a niche market of audiophiles. The phonograph record has made a niche resurgence in the early 21st century – 9.2 million records were sold in the U.S. in 2014, a 260% increase since 2009.

"Denial of service attacks are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. Attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victim account to be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once. While a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule, many forms of Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are possible, where the attack comes from a large number of points – and defending is much more difficult.

"During the Napoleonic Occupation of Spain, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a Catholic priest of progressive ideas, declared Mexican independence in the small town of Dolores, Guanajuato on September 16, 1810 with a proclamation known as the ""Grito de Dolores"". Hidalgo built a large support among intellectuals, liberal priests and many poor people. Hidalgo fought to protect the rights of the poor and indigenous population. He started on a march to the capital, Mexico City, but retreated back north when faced with the elite of the royal forces at the outskirts of the capital. He established a liberal government from Guadalajara, Jalisco but was soon forced to flee north by the royal forces that recaptured the city. Hidalgo attempted to reach the United States and gain American support for Mexican independence. HIdalgo reached Saltillo, Coahuila where he publicly resigned his military post and rejected a pardon offered by Viceroy Francisco Venegas in return for Hidalgo's surrender. A short time later, he and his supporters were captured by royalist Ignacio Elizondo at the Wells of Baján (Norias de Baján) on March 21, 1811 and taken to the city of Chihuahua. Hidalgo forced the Bishop of Valladolid, Manuel Abad y Queipo, to rescind the excommunication order he had circulated against him on September 24, 1810. Later, the Inquisition issued an excommunication edict on October 13, 1810 condemning Miguel Hidalgo as a seditionary, apostate, and heretic.",298,What was the name of the proclamation that declared Mexico's independence called?,"the ""Grito de Dolores","March 21, 1811","September 24, 1810","October 13, 1810",1,"አብ እዋን እቲ Napoleonic ሞያ ካብ ,Spain Miguel Hidalgo y ,Costilla ሓደ Catholic ቀሺ ካብ progressive ,ideas declared Mexican independence አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ንኡስ ንእሽተይ ከተማ ካብ ,Dolores Guanajuato አብ ልዕሊ መስከረም ,16 1810 ምስ ሓደ proclamation ፍሉጥ ከም እቲ ""Grito de "".Dolores Hidalgo ተሃኒጹ ሓደ ገዚፍ ሓገዝ ካብዞም ,intellectuals liberal priests እና ቡዙሕ ድኻ .ህዝቢ Hidalgo ተባኣሰ ናብ ሓሉ እቲ rights ካብ እቲ ድኻ እና ዘይእሩም .በዝሒ ህዝቢ ንሱ ተጀሚሩ አብ ልዕሊ ሓደ መጋቢት ናብ እቲ ,ሃብቲ Mexico ,ከተማ ግን retreated ዝባን ሰሜን መዓዝ faced ምስ እቲ elite ካብ እቲ royal forces ኣብ እቲ outskirts ካብ እቲ .ሃብቲ ንሱ ዝተመስረተ ሓደ liberal መንግስቲ ካብ ,Guadalajara Jalisco ግን ኔሩ አብ ቀረባ forced ናብ ምህዳም ሰሜን ብ እቲ royal forces እቲ recaptured እቲ .ከተማ Hidalgo attempted ናብ ብፅሕ እቲ United States እና ርኸብ American ሓገዝ ን Mexican .independence HIdalgo በጸሐ ,Saltillo Coahuila አበይ ንሱ publicly resigned ናቱ ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት ለጥፍ እና rejected ሓደ ይቕረታ offered ብ Viceroy Francisco Venegas አብ ውሽጢ ተመለስ ን 'Hidalgo's .ኢድካ ምሃብ ሓደ ሓፂር ግዜ ,ዳሕራይ ንሱ እና ናቱ supporters ኔሮም captured ብ royalist Ignacio Elizondo ኣብ እቲ Wells ካብ Baján (Norias de )Baján አብ ልዕሊ መጋቢት ,21 1811 እና ተወሲዱ ናብ እቲ ከተማ ካብ .Chihuahua Hidalgo forced እቲ Bishop ካብ ,Valladolid Manuel Abad y ,Queipo ናብ rescind እቲ excommunication ስርዓት ንሱ ዝነበረ circulated ተቃራኒ ንሱ አብ ልዕሊ መስከረም ,24 .1810 ,ዳሕራይ እቲ Inquisition issued ሓደ excommunication edict አብ ልዕሊ ጥቅምቲ ,13 1810 condemning Miguel Hidalgo ከም ሓደ ,seditionary ,apostate እና .heretic",እንታይ ኔሩ እቲ ሽም ካብ እቲ proclamation እቲ declared 'Mexico's independence ?ዝተፀወዐ,"እቲ ""Grito de Dolores","መጋቢት ,21 1811","መስከረም ,24 1810","ጥቅምቲ ,13 1810"

"Despite the large number of philosophical schools and subtle nuances between many, all philosophies are said to fall into one of two primary categories, which are defined in contrast to each other: Idealism, and materialism.[a] The basic proposition of these two categories pertains to the nature of reality, and the primary distinction between them is the way they answer two fundamental questions: ""what does reality consist of?"" and ""how does it originate?"" To idealists, spirit or mind or the objects of mind (ideas) are primary, and matter secondary.

"On 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly recommended the adoption and implementation of the Partition Plan for Mandatory Palestine. This UN plan specified borders for new Arab and Jewish states and also specified an area of Jerusalem and its environs which was to be administered by the UN under an international regime. The end of the British Mandate for Palestine was set for midnight on 14 May 1948. That day, David Ben-Gurion, the executive head of the Zionist Organization and president of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, declared ""the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel,"" which would start to function from the termination of the mandate. The borders of the new state were not specified in the declaration. Neighboring Arab armies invaded the former Palestinian mandate on the next day and fought the Israeli forces. Israel has since fought several wars with neighboring Arab states, in the course of which it has occupied the West Bank, Sinai Peninsula (1956–57, 1967–82), part of Southern Lebanon (1982–2000), Gaza Strip (1967–2005; still considered occupied after 2005 disengagement) and the Golan Heights. It extended its laws to the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem, but not the West Bank. Efforts to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict have not resulted in peace. However, peace treaties between Israel and both Egypt and Jordan have successfully been signed. Israel's occupation of Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem is the world's longest military occupation in modern times.[note 2]",302,On what date was the Partition Plan for Mandatory Palestine recommended?,2,UN,Eretz,29 November 1947,4,"አብ ልዕሊ 29 ሕዳር ,1947 እቲ United Nations ሓፈሻዊ ኣኼባ ዝምከር እቲ adoption እና implementation ካብ እቲ Partition ትልሚ ን ወሳኒ .Palestine እዚ UN ትልሚ specified borders ን ሓድሽ Arab እና Jewish states እና እውን specified ሓደ ስፍሓት ካብ Jerusalem እና ናቱ environs አየናይ ኔሩ ናብ ኩን administered ብ እቲ UN ትሕቲ ሓደ ዓለም ለኻዊ .regime እቲ መወዳእታ ካብ እቲ British Mandate ን Palestine ኔሩ ፅምዲ ን ፍርቂ ለይቲ አብ ልዕሊ 14 ተዝኸዉን .1948 እቲ ,መዓልቲ David -,Ben-Gurion እቲ ኣካያዲ ስራሕ ርእሲ ካብ እቲ Zionist ውድብ እና ፕረዝደንት ካብ እቲ Jewish ትካል ን ,Palestine declared ""እቲ establishment ካብ ሓደ Jewish ግዝኣት አብ ውሽጢ Eretz ,Israel ናብ ኩን ፍሉጥ ከም እቲ ግዝኣት ካብ ,""Israel አየናይ ይኸውን ጀምር ናብ ተግባር ካብ እቲ termination ካብ እቲ .mandate እቲ borders ካብ እቲ ሓድሽ ግዝኣት ኔሮም ዘይኮነ specified አብ ውሽጢ እቲ .declaration Neighboring Arab armies invaded እቲ ናይ ቀደም Palestinian mandate አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ቀፃሊ መዓልቲ እና ተባኣሰ እቲ Israeli .forces Israel ኣለዎ ካብ ተባኣሰ ቡዙሓት wars ምስ neighboring Arab ,states አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ዓይነት ትምህርቲ ካብ አየናይ እቲ ነገር ኣለዎ ብስራሕ ትሑዝ እቲ ምዕራብ ,ባንኪ Sinai Peninsula (,1956–57 ),1967–82 ክፋል ካብ Southern Lebanon (),1982–2000 Gaza ቁራፅ (;1967–2005 እስካብ ሕዚ ገምገመ ብስራሕ ትሑዝ ድሕሪ 2005 )disengagement እና እቲ Golan .Heights እቲ ነገር ተናዊሑ ናቱ laws ናብ እቲ Golan Heights እና ምብራቅ ,Jerusalem ግን ዘይኮነ እቲ ምዕራብ .ባንኪ Efforts ናብ ምፍታሕ እቲ Israeli–Palestinian ባእሲ ኣለኒ ዘይኮነ resulted አብ ውሽጢ .ሰላም ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ሰላም treaties አብ መንጎ Israel እና ክልቲኡ Egypt እና Jordan ኣለኒ successfully ዝነበረ .signed 'Israel's ሞያ ካብ ,Gaza እቲ ምዕራብ ባንኪ እና ምብራቅ Jerusalem እዩ እቲ 'world's longest ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት ሞያ አብ ውሽጢ ዘበናዊ .[times.[note ]2",አብ ልዕሊ እንታይ ዕለት ኔሩ እቲ Partition ትልሚ ን ወሳኒ Palestine ?ዝምከር,2,UN,Eretz,29 ሕዳር 1947

"Robert Plutchik agreed with Ekman's biologically driven perspective but developed the ""wheel of emotions"", suggesting eight primary emotions grouped on a positive or negative basis: joy versus sadness; anger versus fear; trust versus disgust; and surprise versus anticipation. Some basic emotions can be modified to form complex emotions. The complex emotions could arise from cultural conditioning or association combined with the basic emotions. Alternatively, similar to the way primary colors combine, primary emotions could blend to form the full spectrum of human emotional experience. For example, interpersonal anger and disgust could blend to form contempt.

"After the Fall of Rome, the Catholic Church became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe. The church established cathedral schools in the Early Middle Ages as centers of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into medieval universities and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities. During the High Middle Ages, Chartres Cathedral operated the famous and influential Chartres Cathedral School. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including Thomas Aquinas of the University of Naples, Robert Grosseteste of the University of Oxford, an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation, and Saint Albert the Great, a pioneer of biological field research.

"The Labour Party's origins lie in the late 19th century, when it became apparent that there was a need for a new political party to represent the interests and needs of the urban proletariat, a demographic which had increased in number and had recently been given franchise. Some members of the trades union movement became interested in moving into the political field, and after further extensions of the voting franchise in 1867 and 1885, the Liberal Party endorsed some trade-union sponsored candidates. The first Lib–Lab candidate to stand was George Odger in the Southwark by-election of 1870. In addition, several small socialist groups had formed around this time, with the intention of linking the movement to political policies. Among these were the Independent Labour Party, the intellectual and largely middle-class Fabian Society, the Marxist Social Democratic Federation and the Scottish Labour Party.",310,When was the Labour Party born?,first,Lib,Fabian,the late 19th century,4,"እቲ ናይ ጉልበት ስራሕ 'Party's origins ሓሶት አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ረፋድ 19th ,ዘመን መዓዝ እቲ ነገር ኮይኑ ግልፂ እቲ ኣብቲ ኔሩ ሓደ ድሌት ን ሓደ ሓድሽ political ጓይላ ናብ ውክልና እቲ interests እና needs ካብ እቲ ከተማ ,proletariat ሓደ demographic አየናይ ዝነበረ ወሰኽ አብ ውሽጢ ቑጽሪ እና ዝነበረ ኣብ ቀረባ ዝነበረ ዝተወሃበ .franchise ንእሽተይ members ካብ እቲ trades union ምንቅስቓስ ኮይኑ ዝደሊ አብ ውሽጢ moving ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ political ,ሜዳ እና ድሕሪ ርሑቅ extensions ካብ እቲ voting franchise አብ ውሽጢ 1867 እና ,1885 እቲ Liberal ጓይላ endorsed ንእሽተይ -trade-union sponsored .candidates እቲ መጀመርታ Lib–Lab candidate ናብ ደው ምባል ኔሩ George Odger አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Southwark -by-election ካብ .1870 አብ ውሽጢ ,ተወሳኺ ቡዙሓት ንኡስ socialist groups ዝነበረ formed አብ ከባቢ እዚ ,ግዜ ምስ እቲ ሓሳብ ካብ linking እቲ ምንቅስቓስ ናብ political .policies ካብዞም እዚ ኔሮም እቲ ዓርሱ ዝኸኣለ ናይ ጉልበት ስራሕ ,ጓይላ እቲ ምሁራዊ እና largely -middle-class Fabian ,ሕብረተሰብ እቲ Marxist ማሕበራዊ Democratic Federation እና እቲ Scottish ናይ ጉልበት ስራሕ .ጓይላ",መዓዝ ኔሩ እቲ ናይ ጉልበት ስራሕ ጓይላ ?ተወሊዱ,መጀመርታ,Lib,Fabian,እቲ ረፋድ 19th ዘመን

"The Macintosh, however, was expensive, which hindered its ability to be competitive in a market already dominated by the Commodore 64 for consumers, as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses. Macintosh systems still found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade.

"The emergence of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is a common phenomenon. Emergence of resistance often reflects evolutionary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy. The antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics. Under certain conditions, it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria, while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug. For example, antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the Luria–Delbrück experiment. Antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin, which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains, have become less effective, due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains.",316,What kind of processes are the emergence of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics common?,Luria,1943,Delbrück,evolutionary processes,4,"እቲ emergence ካብ ተቓውሞ ካብ bacteria ናብ antibiotics እዩ ሓደ ልሙድ .ኽስተት Emergence ካብ ተቓውሞ ኩል ግዘ reflects evolutionary processes እቲ ውሰድ ቦታ አብ እዋን antibiotic .therapy እቲ antibiotic ህክምና ተዝኸዉን ምረፅ ን bacterial strains ምስ physiologically ወይ genetically enhanced ትኽእሎ ናብ ህላወ ላዕሊ doses ካብ .antibiotics ትሕቲ ውሱን ,ኩነታት እቲ ነገር ተዝኸዉን ውፅኢት አብ ውሽጢ preferential ዕቤት ካብ resistant ,bacteria እስካብ ዕቤት ካብ susceptible bacteria እዩ inhibited ብ እቲ .drug ን ,ኣብነት antibacterial selection ን strains ምህላው previously ዝተዓደገ -antibacterial-resistance genes ኔሩ demonstrated አብ ውሽጢ 1943 ብ እቲ Luria–Delbrück .ቤተ-ፈተነ Antibiotics ከምዚ ከም penicillin እና ,erythromycin አየናይ ዘገልገለ ናብ ኣለኒ ሓደ ላዕሊ efficacy ተቃራኒ ቡዙሕ bacterial ዓሌታት እና ,strains ኣለኒ ምዃን ዝወሓደ ,ውፅኢታዊ መወዳእታ ናብ እቲ ወሰኽ ተቓውሞ ካብ ቡዙሕ bacterial .strains",እንታይ ርህሩህ ካብ processes እዮም እቲ emergence ካብ ተቓውሞ ካብ bacteria ናብ antibiotics ?ልሙድ,Luria,1943,Delbrück,evolutionary processes

"There are many styles of mandolin, but four are common, the Neapolitan or round-backed mandolin, the carved-top mandolin and the flat-backed mandolin. The round-back has a deep bottom, constructed of strips of wood, glued together into a bowl. The carved-top or arch-top mandolin has a much shallower, arched back, and an arched top—both carved out of wood. The flat-backed mandolin uses thin sheets of wood for the body, braced on the inside for strength in a similar manner to a guitar. Each style of instrument has its own sound quality and is associated with particular forms of music. Neapolitan mandolins feature prominently in European classical music and traditional music. Carved-top instruments are common in American folk music and bluegrass music. Flat-backed instruments are commonly used in Irish, British and Brazilian folk music.

An oscillating current of electrons forced through the antenna by a transmitter will create an oscillating magnetic field around the antenna elements, while the charge of the electrons also creates an oscillating electric field along the elements. These time-varying fields radiate away from the antenna into space as a moving transverse electromagnetic field wave.

"Napoléon Bonaparte (/nəˈpoʊliən, -ˈpoʊljən/; French: [napɔleɔ̃ bɔnapaʁt], born Napoleone di Buonaparte; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. Often considered one of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. He also remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political figures in Western history. In civil affairs, Napoleon had a major long-term impact by bringing liberal reforms to the territories that he conquered, especially the Low Countries, Switzerland, and large parts of modern Italy and Germany. He implemented fundamental liberal policies in France and throughout Western Europe.[note 1] His lasting legal achievement, the Napoleonic Code, has been adopted in various forms by a quarter of the world's legal systems, from Japan to Quebec.",323,When was Napoleon Bonaparte born?,15 August 1769,Japan,Europe,Switzerland,1,"Napoléon Bonaparte (/,nəˈpoʊliən -/;ˈpoʊljən :French [napɔleɔ̃ ],bɔnapaʁt ተወሊዱ Napoleone di ;Buonaparte 15 ነሓሰ 1769 – 5 ተዝኸዉን )1821 ኔሩ ሓደ French ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት እና political መራሒ መን rose ናብ prominence አብ እዋን እቲ French ለውጢ እና መረሐ ቡዙሓት ዕውት campaigns አብ እዋን እቲ Revolutionary .Wars ከም Napoleon ,ኣነ ንሱ ኔሩ Emperor ካብ እቲ French ካብ 1804 ክሳብ ,1814 እና ካልኣይ አብ ውሽጢ .1815 Napoleon dominated European እና ዓለምለኻዊ affairs ን ቡዙሕ ካብ ሓደ ዓሰርተ ዓመት እስካብ leading France ተቃራኒ ሓደ ተኸታታሊ ካብ coalitions አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Napoleonic .Wars ንሱ ተዓወተ ብጥዕሚ ካብ እዚ wars እና እቲ ሰፊሕ መብዛሕትኡ ካብ ናቱ ,battles ምህናፅ ሓደ ገዚፍ empire እቲ ruled ልዕሊ continental Europe ቅድሚ ናቱ final ፈረሰ አብ ውሽጢ .1815 ኩል ግዘ ገምገመ ሓደ ካብ እቲ greatest commanders አብ ውሽጢ ,ታሪኽ ናቱ wars እና campaigns እዮም studied ኣብ ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት schools .worldwide ንሱ እውን remains ሓደ ካብ እቲ ብጥዕሚ celebrated እና ዘከራኽር political figures አብ ውሽጢ Western .ታሪኽ አብ ውሽጢ civil ,affairs Napoleon ዝነበረ ሓደ ዋና -long-term ፅልዋ ብ bringing liberal reforms ናብ እቲ territories እቲ ንሱ ,conquered ብፍላይ እቲ ውሑድ ,Countries ,Switzerland እና ገዚፍ parts ካብ ዘበናዊ Italy እና .Germany ንሱ implemented መሰረታዊ liberal policies አብ ውሽጢ France እና በቲ Western .[Europe.[note ]1 ናቱ lasting ሕጋዊ ,ዓወት እቲ Napoleonic ,Code ኣለዎ ዝነበረ adopted አብ ውሽጢ ዝተፈላለዩ forms ብ ሓደ ርብዒ ካብ እቲ 'world's ሕጋዊ ,systems ካብ Japan ናብ .Quebec",መዓዝ ኔሩ Napoleon Bonaparte ?ተወሊዱ,15 ነሓሰ 1769,Japan,Europe,Switzerland

"Serbo-Croatian was standardized in the mid-19th-century Vienna Literary Agreement by Croatian and Serbian writers and philologists, decades before a Yugoslav state was established. From the very beginning, there were slightly different literary Serbian and Croatian standards, although both were based on the same Shtokavian subdialect, Eastern Herzegovinian. In the 20th century, Serbo-Croatian served as the official language of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (when it was called ""Serbo-Croato-Slovenian""), and later as one of the official languages of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The breakup of Yugoslavia affected language attitudes, so that social conceptions of the language separated on ethnic and political lines. Since the breakup of Yugoslavia, Bosnian has likewise been established as an official standard in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and there is an ongoing movement to codify a separate Montenegrin standard.

This created an association called the Labour Representation Committee (LRC), meant to coordinate attempts to support MPs sponsored by trade unions and represent the working-class population. It had no single leader, and in the absence of one, the Independent Labour Party nominee Ramsay MacDonald was elected as Secretary. He had the difficult task of keeping the various strands of opinions in the LRC united.

Most textbooks still use the traditional division into polychaetes (almost all marine), oligochaetes (which include earthworms) and leech-like species.

In addition, the Pogonophora, Echiura and Sipuncula, previously regarded as separate phyla, are now regarded as sub-groups of polychaetes.

"The FAA gradually assumed additional functions. The hijacking epidemic of the 1960s had already brought the agency into the field of civil aviation security. In response to the hijackings on September 11, 2001, this responsibility is now primarily taken by the Department of Homeland Security.

"In philosophy, idealism is the group of philosophies which assert that reality, or reality as we can know it, is fundamentally mental, mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial. Epistemologically, idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In a sociological sense, idealism emphasizes how human ideas—especially beliefs and values—shape society. As an ontological doctrine, idealism goes further, asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit.

"The priesthoods of public religion were held by members of the elite classes. There was no principle analogous to separation of church and state in ancient Rome. During the Roman Republic (509–27 BC), the same men who were elected public officials might also serve as augurs and pontiffs. Priests married, raised families, and led politically active lives. Julius Caesar became pontifex maximus before he was elected consul. The augurs read the will of the gods and supervised the marking of boundaries as a reflection of universal order, thus sanctioning Roman expansionism as a matter of divine destiny. The Roman triumph was at its core a religious procession in which the victorious general displayed his piety and his willingness to serve the public good by dedicating a portion of his spoils to the gods, especially Jupiter, who embodied just rule. As a result of the Punic Wars (264–146 BC), when Rome struggled to establish itself as a dominant power, many new temples were built by magistrates in fulfillment of a vow to a deity for assuring their military success.",346,When did the Roman Republic occur?,Rome,Jupiter,509–27,Roman,3,"እቲ priesthoods ካብ ህዝባዊ ሃይማኖት ኔሮም ተገይሩ ብ members ካብ እቲ elite .classes ኣብቲ ኔሩ አይኮንን principle analogous ናብ separation ካብ ቤተ ክርስትያን እና ግዝኣት አብ ውሽጢ ጥንታዊ .Rome አብ እዋን እቲ Roman Republic (509–27 ),BC እቲ ማዕረ men መን ኔሮም elected ህዝባዊ officials ይኸዉን እውን ኣገልገለ ከም augurs እና .pontiffs Priests ,ምርዕው ተሰአ ,families እና መረሐ politically ንቑሕ .ይነብር Julius Caesar ኮይኑ pontifex maximus ቅድሚ ንሱ ኔሩ elected .consul እቲ augurs ኣንብብ እቲ ንመፃእ ካብ እቲ gods እና supervised እቲ marking ካብ ዶባት ከም ሓደ ምስትንታን ካብ universal ,ስርዓት ስለዝኾነ sanctioning Roman expansionism ከም ሓደ ነገር ካብ መለኮታዊ .ዕድል እቲ Roman triumph ኔሩ ኣብ ናቱ ማእኸል ሓደ ሃይማኖታዊ procession አብ ውሽጢ አየናይ እቲ victorious ሓፈሻዊ displayed ናቱ piety እና ናቱ willingness ናብ ኣገልገለ እቲ ህዝባዊ ፅቡቅ ብ dedicating ሓደ portion ካብ ናቱ spoils ናብ እቲ ,gods ብፍላይ ,Jupiter መን embodied ጥራሕ .ስርዓት ከም ሓደ ውፅኢት ካብ እቲ Punic Wars (264–146 ),BC መዓዝ Rome struggled ናብ መስርት itself ከም ሓደ ዓብላሊ ,ሓይሊ ቡዙሕ ሓድሽ temples ኔሮም ተሃኒጹ ብ magistrates አብ ውሽጢ fulfillment ካብ ሓደ vow ናብ ሓደ deity ን assuring ናቶም ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት .ዓወት",መዓዝ ግቡር እቲ Roman Republic ?ይፍፀም,Rome,Jupiter,509–27,Roman
"The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as The Adventures of Tintin. American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (manga) propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. Comics has had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia.",347,When did comics begin to emerge?,Osamu Tezuka,Superman,Belgium,the mid-20th century,4,"እቲ ታሪኽ ካብ comics ኣለዎ followed ፍሉይ paths አብ ውሽጢ ፍሉይ .cultures Scholars ኣለኒ posited ሓደ -pre-history ከም ርሑቅ ዝባን ከም እቲ Lascaux ባዓቲ .paintings ብ እቲ -mid-20th ,ዘመን comics flourished ብፍላይ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ United ,States western Europe (ብፍላይ አብ ውሽጢ France እና ),Belgium እና .Japan እቲ ታሪኽ ካብ European comics እዩ ኩል ግዘ traced ናብ Rodolphe 'Töpffer's cartoon strips ካብ እቲ ,1830s እና ኮይኑ ህቡብ ምኽታል እቲ ዓወት አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 1930s ካብ strips እና books ከምዚ ከም እቲ Adventures ካብ .Tintin American comics emerged ከም ሓደ መጠን ኣካል ማእኸላይ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ብግዘ 20th ዘመን ምስ እቲ advent ካብ newspaper comic ;strips -magazine-style comic books followed አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ,1930s አብ ውሽጢ አየናይ እቲ superhero ወግዒ ኮይኑ ጠቃሚ ድሕሪ Superman ወፀ አብ ውሽጢ .1938 Histories ካብ Japanese comics እና cartooning ()manga propose origins ከም ብግዘ ከም እቲ 12th .ዘመን ዘበናዊ comic strips emerged አብ ውሽጢ Japan አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ብግዘ 20th ,ዘመን እና እቲ output ካብ comics magazines እና books ብቕልጡፍ expanded አብ ውሽጢ እቲ -post-World ውግእ II era ምስ እቲ popularity ካብ cartoonists ከምዚ ከም Osamu .Tezuka Comics ኣለዎ ዝነበረ ሓደ lowbrow ክብሪ ን ብዙሕ ካብ ናቱ ,ታሪኽ ግን ናብ ገፅ እቲ መወዳእታ ካብ እቲ 20th ዘመን ጀሚሩ ናብ ርኸብ greater acceptance ምስ እቲ ህዝባዊ እና አብ ውሽጢ .academia",መዓዝ ግቡር comics ጀምር ናብ ?ተቐልቀለ,Osamu Tezuka,Superman,Belgium,እቲ -mid-20th ዘመን

"Copper occurs naturally as native copper and was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record. It has a history of use that is at least 10,000 years old, and estimates of its discovery place it at 9000 BC in the Middle East; a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC. There is evidence that gold and meteoric iron (but not iron smelting) were the only metals used by humans before copper. The history of copper metallurgy is thought to have followed the following sequence: 1) cold working of native copper, 2) annealing, 3) smelting, and 4) the lost wax method. In southeastern Anatolia, all four of these metallurgical techniques appears more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic c. 7500 BC. However, just as agriculture was independently invented in several parts of the world, copper smelting was invented locally in several different places. It was probably discovered independently in China before 2800 BC, in Central America perhaps around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting was invented in 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK at 2280 to 1890 BC. Ötzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300–3200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest his involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led to the discovery of iron smelting. Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.[citation needed]",350,How old is copper in the Middle East?,UK,China,Southeast Asia,9000,4,"ነሓስ ኮነ naturally ከም መበቆል ነሓስ እና ኔሩ ፍሉጥ ናብ ንእሽተይ ካብ እቲ oldest civilizations አብ ልዕሊ .ቅዳሕ እቲ ነገር ኣለዎ ሓደ ታሪኽ ካብ ጥቅሚ እቲ እዩ ኣብ ዝነኣሰ ,10,000 ዓመታት ,ዓብይ እና estimates ካብ ናቱ discovery ቦታ እቲ ነገር ኣብ 9000 BC አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ማእኸል ;ምብራቅ ሓደ ነሓስ pendant ኔሩ ተረኺቡ አብ ውሽጢ northern Iraq እቲ dates ናብ 8700 .BC ኣብቲ እዩ ማስረጃ እቲ ወርቂ እና meteoric ሓፂን (ግን ዘይኮነ ሓፂን )smelting ኔሮም እቲ ጥራሕ metals ዘገልገለ ብ humans ቅድሚ .ነሓስ እቲ ታሪኽ ካብ ነሓስ metallurgy እዩ ሓሳብ ናብ ኣለኒ followed እቲ ምኽታል :ቕደም ስዓብ )1 ቁሪ ምስራሕ ካብ መበቆል ,ነሓስ )2 ,annealing )3 ,smelting እና )4 እቲ ዝጠፈአ wax .ሜላ አብ ውሽጢ southeastern ,Anatolia ኩሎም ዓርባዕተ ካብ እዚ metallurgical techniques appears ቡዙሕ ወይ ዝወሓደ ብተኻታታሊ ኣብ እቲ መጀመርታ ካብ እቲ Neolithic .c 7500 .BC ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ጥራሕ ከም ግብርና ኔሩ independently invented አብ ውሽጢ ቡዙሓት parts ካብ እቲ ,ዓለም ነሓስ smelting ኔሩ invented locally አብ ውሽጢ ቡዙሓት ፍሉይ .ቦታታት እቲ ነገር ኔሩ ናይ ምዃን ዕድል discovered independently አብ ውሽጢ China ቅድሚ 2800 ,BC አብ ውሽጢ Central America ምናልባት አብ ከባቢ 600 ,AD እና አብ ውሽጢ ምዕራብ Africa ብዝዕባ እቲ 9th ወይ 10th ዘመን .AD Investment casting ኔሩ invented አብ ውሽጢ 4500–4000 BC አብ ውሽጢ Southeast Asia እና carbon dating ኣለዎ ዝተመስረተ mining ኣብ Alderley ጫፍ አብ ውሽጢ ,Cheshire UK ኣብ 2280 ናብ 1890 .BC Ötzi እቲ ,Iceman ሓደ ተባዕታይ dated ካብ 3300–3200 ,BC ኔሩ ተረኺቡ ምስ ሓደ axe ምስ ሓደ ነሓስ ርእሲ .%99.7 ;ፅሩይ ላዕሊ levels ካብ arsenic አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ ፀጉሪ ሓሳብ ምቕራብ ናቱ involvement አብ ውሽጢ ነሓስ .smelting ተሞክሮ ምስ ነሓስ ኣለዎ assisted እቲ ዕብየት ካብ ካልእ ;metals አብ ውሽጢ ,ብፍሉይ ነሓስ smelting መረሐ ናብ እቲ discovery ካብ ሓፂን .smelting ምህርቲ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ዓብይ ነሓስ ሕውስዋስ አብ ውሽጢ Michigan እና Wisconsin እዩ dated አብ መንጎ 6000 እና 3000 .BC ተፈጥራዊ ,bronze ሓደ ዓይነት ካብ ነሓስ ዝተሰርሐ ካብ ores ሓፍታም አብ ውሽጢ ,silicon ,arsenic እና ()ሓልሓሊፉ ,tin መጺኡ ናብ ውሽጢ ሓፈሻዊ ጥቅሚ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Balkans አብ ከባቢ 5500 .[BC.[citation ]needed",ከመይ ዓብይ እዩ ነሓስ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ማእኸል ?ምብራቅ,UK,China,Southeast Asia,9000

"First recognized in 1900 by Max Planck, it was originally the proportionality constant between the minimal increment of energy, E, of a hypothetical electrically charged oscillator in a cavity that contained black body radiation, and the frequency, f, of its associated electromagnetic wave.

"Roman government was headed by two consuls, elected annually by the citizens and advised by a senate composed of appointed magistrates. As Roman society was very hierarchical by modern standards, the evolution of the Roman government was heavily influenced by the struggle between the patricians, Rome's land-holding aristocracy, who traced their ancestry to the founding of Rome, and the plebeians, the far more numerous citizen-commoners. Over time, the laws that gave patricians exclusive rights to Rome's highest offices were repealed or weakened, and leading plebeian families became full members of the aristocracy. The leaders of the Republic developed a strong tradition and morality requiring public service and patronage in peace and war, making military and political success inextricably linked. Many of Rome's legal and legislative structures (later codified into the Justinian Code, and again into the Napoleonic Code) can still be observed throughout Europe and much of the world in modern nation states and international organizations.",363,How often did the Roman government elect two consuls?,annually,the Justinian Code,Europe,the Napoleonic Code,1,"Roman መንግስቲ ኔሩ headed ብ ክልተ ,consuls elected annually ብ እቲ citizens እና advised ብ ሓደ senate composed ካብ appointed .magistrates ከም Roman ሕብረተሰብ ኔሩ ብጣዕሚ hierarchical ብ ዘበናዊ ,standards እቲ ደፋእታዊ ለውጢ ካብ እቲ Roman መንግስቲ ኔሩ heavily influenced ብ እቲ ገልታዕታዕ አብ መንጎ እቲ ,patricians 'Rome's -land-holding ,aristocracy መን traced ናቶም ancestry ናብ እቲ founding ካብ ,Rome እና እቲ ,plebeians እቲ ርሑቅ ቡዙሕ numerous -.citizen-commoners ልዕሊ ,ግዜ እቲ laws እቲ ሂቡ patricians ንበይኑ rights ናብ 'Rome's highest offices ኔሮም repealed ወይ ,weakened እና leading plebeian families ኮይኑ ሙሉእ members ካብ እቲ .aristocracy እቲ leaders ካብ እቲ Republic ምዕቡል ሓደ ጠንካራ ልምዲ እና morality requiring ህዝባዊ ግልጋሎት እና patronage አብ ውሽጢ ሰላም እና ,ውግእ making ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት እና political ዓወት inextricably .linked ቡዙሕ ካብ 'Rome's ሕጋዊ እና legislative structures (ዳሕራይ codified ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ Justinian ,Code እና ካልኣይ ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ Napoleonic )Code ይኽእል እስካብ ሕዚ ኩን observed በቲ Europe እና ብዙሕ ካብ እቲ ዓለም አብ ውሽጢ ዘበናዊ nation states እና ዓለም ለኻዊ .organizations",ከመይ ኩል ግዘ ግቡር እቲ Roman መንግስቲ elect ክልተ ?consuls,annually,እቲ Justinian Code,Europe,እቲ Napoleonic Code

Alternatively, similar to the way primary colors combine, primary emotions could blend to form the full spectrum of human emotional experience.

As a strategic location in the Middle East, it was subsequently occupied by several major powers, including the empires of the Assyrians, Egyptians and Persians, from whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great. Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt, the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire, Arab caliphates for a short period, the French Lusignan dynasty and the Venetians, was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 (de jure until 1914).",368,When did early people first live on Cyprus?,between 1571 and 1878,10th,Alexander the Great,Mycenaean Greeks,2,"እቲ earliest ፍሉጥ ሰብ ንጥፈት አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ደሴት dates ናብ አብ ከባቢ እቲ 10th millennium .BC Archaeological remains ካብ እዚ ግዘ ይሓውስ እቲ -well-preserved Neolithic ገጠር ካብ ,Khirokitia እና Cyprus እዩ ገዛ ናብ ንእሽተይ ካብ እቲ oldest ማይ wells አብ ውሽጢ እቲ .ዓለም Cyprus ኔሩ settled ብ Mycenaean Greeks አብ ውሽጢ ክልተ waves አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 2nd millennium .BC ከም ሓደ strategic ኣንፈት አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ማእኸል ,ምብራቅ እቲ ነገር ኔሩ subsequently ብስራሕ ትሑዝ ብ ቡዙሓት ዋና ,powers ይሓውስ እቲ empires ካብ እቲ ,Assyrians Egyptians እና ,Persians ካብ መን እቲ ደሴት ኔሩ seized አብ ውሽጢ 333 BC ብ Alexander እቲ .ምዑዝ Subsequent ስርዓት ብ Ptolemaic ,Egypt እቲ Classical እና Eastern Roman ,Empire Arab caliphates ን ሓደ ሓፂር ,ግዘ እቲ French Lusignan dynasty እና እቲ ,Venetians ኔሩ followed ብ ልዕሊ ሰለስተ centuries ካብ Ottoman ስርዓት አብ መንጎ 1571 እና 1878 (de jure ክሳብ ).1914",መዓዝ ግቡር ብግዘ ህዝቢ መጀመርታ ንበር አብ ልዕሊ ?Cyprus,አብ መንጎ 1571 እና 1878,10th,Alexander እቲ ምዑዝ,Mycenaean Greeks
"Zinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30. It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table. In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest mineable amounts are found in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc production includes froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).",369,How many atomic numbers does zinc have?,Asia,30,Earth,the United States,2,"Zinc እዩ ሓደ chemical ባእታ ምስ ምልክት Zn እና atomic ቑጽሪ .30 እቲ ነገር እዩ እቲ መጀመርታ ባእታ ካብ ጉጅለ 12 ካብ እቲ periodic .ጠረጴዛ አብ ውሽጢ ንእሽተይ respects zinc እዩ chemically ተመሳሳሊ ናብ :magnesium ናቱ ion እዩ ካብ ተመሳሳሊ ግዝፊ እና ናቱ ጥራሕ ልሙድ oxidation ግዝኣት እዩ +.2 Zinc እዩ እቲ 24th ብጥዕሚ ኣኺሉ ዝተረፈ ባእታ አብ ውሽጢ 'Earth's crust እና ኣለዎ ሓሙሽተ ዝተረጋገአ .isotopes እቲ ብጥዕሚ ልሙድ zinc ore እዩ sphalerite (zinc ),blende ሓደ zinc sulfide .mineral እቲ largest mineable amounts እዮም ተረኺቡ አብ ውሽጢ ,Australia ,Asia እና እቲ United .States Zinc ምህርቲ includes froth flotation ካብ እቲ ,ore ,roasting እና final extraction using electricity ().electrowinning",ከመይ ቡዙሕ atomic numbers ምግባር zinc ?ኣለኒ,Asia,30,መሬት,እቲ United States
"The Sahara (Arabic: الصحراء الكبرى‎, aṣ-ṣaḥrāʾ al-kubrā , 'the Greatest Desert') is the largest hot desert in the world. It is the third largest desert after Antarctica and the Arctic. Its surface area of 9,400,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi)[citation needed]—including the Libyan Desert—is comparable to the respective land areas of China or the United States. The desert comprises much of the land found within North Africa, excluding the fertile coastal region situated against the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley of Egypt and Sudan. The Sahara stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north, to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually transitions to a coastal plain. To the south, it is delimited by the Sahel, a belt of semi-arid tropical savanna around the Niger River valley and Sudan Region of Sub-Saharan Africa. The Sahara can be divided into several regions, including the western Sahara, the central Ahaggar Mountains, the Tibesti Mountains, the Aïr Mountains, the Ténéré desert, and the Libyan Desert.

The Philosophes, the French term for the philosophers of the period, widely circulated their ideas through meetings at scientific academies, Masonic lodges, literary salons and coffee houses, and through printed books and pamphlets. The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined the authority of the monarchy and the church, and paved the way for the revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries.

"Pesticides are substances meant for attracting, seducing, and then destroying any pest. They are a class of biocide. The most common use of pesticides is as plant protection products (also known as crop protection products), which in general protect plants from damaging influences such as weeds, fungi, or insects. This use of pesticides is so common that the term pesticide is often treated as synonymous with plant protection product, although it is in fact a broader term, as pesticides are also used for non-agricultural purposes. The term pesticide includes all of the following: herbicide, insecticide, insect growth regulator, nematicide, termiticide, molluscicide, piscicide, avicide, rodenticide, predacide, bactericide, insect repellent, animal repellent, antimicrobial, fungicide, disinfectant (antimicrobial), and sanitizer.",381,What type of substance is used for killing pests?,acaricide.n.01,pediculicide.n.01,pesticides,arsenical.n.01,3,"Pesticides እዮም substances ናይ ብሓቂ ን ,attracting ,seducing እና ሽዑ destroying ዝኾነ .pest ንሶም እዮም ሓደ ክፍሊ ካብ .biocide እቲ ብጥዕሚ ልሙድ ጥቅሚ ካብ pesticides እዩ ከም ተኽሊ protection products (እውን ፍሉጥ ከም እኽሊ protection ),products አየናይ አብ ውሽጢ ሓፈሻዊ ሓሉ ተኽልታት ካብ damaging influences ከምዚ ከም ,weeds ,fungi ወይ .insects እዚ ጥቅሚ ካብ pesticides እዩ ስለዚ ልሙድ እቲ እቲ ቃል pesticide እዩ ኩል ግዘ treated ከም synonymous ምስ ተኽሊ protection ,ፍርያት ዋላ እኳ እቲ ነገር እዩ አብ ውሽጢ ሓቂ ሓደ broader ,ቃል ከም pesticides እዮም እውን ዘገልገለ ን -non-agricultural .purposes እቲ ቃል pesticide includes ኩሎም ካብ እቲ :ምኽታል ,herbicide ,insecticide ሓሰኻ ዕቤት ,regulator ,nematicide ,termiticide ,molluscicide ,piscicide ,avicide ,rodenticide ,predacide ,bactericide ሓሰኻ ,repellent እንስሳ ,repellent ,antimicrobial ,fungicide disinfectant (),antimicrobial እና .sanitizer",እንታይ ዓይነት ካብ ዓውደ ኣካል እዩ ዘገልገለ ን killing ?pests,..acaricide.n.01,..pediculicide.n.01,pesticides,..arsenical.n.01

"Circadian rhythms allow organisms to anticipate and prepare for precise and regular environmental changes. They thus enable organisms to best capitalize on environmental resources (e.g. light and food) compared to those that cannot predict such availability. It has therefore been suggested that circadian rhythms put organisms at a selective advantage in evolutionary terms. However, rhythmicity appears to be as important in regulating and coordinating internal metabolic processes, as in coordinating with the environment. This is suggested by the maintenance (heritability) of circadian rhythms in fruit flies after several hundred generations in constant laboratory conditions, as well as in creatures in constant darkness in the wild, and by the experimental elimination of behavioral, but not physiological, circadian rhythms in quail.",385,What type of circadian rhythms allow organisms to anticipate and prepare for precise and regular environmental changes?,several hundred,Circadian,—,—,2,"Circadian rhythms ፍቀድ organisms ናብ ግምት እና ተዳሎ ን ምጽግጋዕ እና ልሙድ environmental .changes ንሶም ስለዝኾነ ኣኽእል organisms ናብ ምሩፅ capitalize አብ ልዕሊ environmental ምንጭታት (..e.g ብርሃን እና )ምግቢ compared ናብ እቲኦም እቲ cannot ምትንባይ ከምዚ .availability እቲ ነገር ኣለዎ ስለዚ ድማ ዝነበረ suggested እቲ circadian rhythms አቅምጥ organisms ኣብ ሓደ selective ጥቅሚ አብ ውሽጢ evolutionary .ስያመታት ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ rhythmicity appears ናብ ኩን ከም ጠቃሚ አብ ውሽጢ regulating እና coordinating ውሽጣዊ metabolic ,processes ከም አብ ውሽጢ coordinating ምስ እቲ .ከባቢ እዚ እዩ suggested ብ እቲ ፅገና ()heritability ካብ circadian rhythms አብ ውሽጢ ፍረ flies ድሕሪ ቡዙሓት ሚእቲ generations አብ ውሽጢ ቀዋሚ laboratory ,ኩነታት ከም ደሓን ከም አብ ውሽጢ creatures አብ ውሽጢ ቀዋሚ darkness አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ,ልቂ እና ብ እቲ experimental elimination ካብ ,behavioral ግን ዘይኮነ ,physiological circadian rhythms አብ ውሽጢ .quail",እንታይ ዓይነት ካብ circadian rhythms ፍቀድ organisms ናብ ግምት እና ተዳሎ ን ምጽግጋዕ እና ልሙድ environmental ?changes,ቡዙሓት ሚእቲ,Circadian,—,—

God is also usually defined as a non-corporeal being without any human biological gender, but the concept of God actively (as opposed to receptively) creating the universe has caused some religions to give ""Him"" the metaphorical name of ""Father"".

"In an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material (detritus)). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the ""donor"" organism(s).",399,What is an interaction where a predator feeds on its prey?,—,—,—,predation,4,"አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ,ecosystem predation እዩ ሓደ biological ምትሕብባር አበይ ሓደ predator (ሓደ organism እቲ እዩ )hunting feeds አብ ልዕሊ ናቱ ግዳይ (እቲ organism እቲ እዩ ).attacked Predators ተዝኸዉን ወይ ተዝኸዉን ዘይኮነ ምቕታል ናቶም ግዳይ ቅድሚያ ናብ feeding አብ ልዕሊ ,ንሶም ግን እቲ ፍፃመ ካብ predation ኩል ግዘ ውፅኢታት አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ሞት ካብ እቲ ግዳይ እና እቲ eventual absorption ካብ እቲ 'prey's ቲሹ ብውሽጢ .ምህላኽ ስለዝኾነ predation እዩ ,ኩል ግዘ እኳ ዘይኮነ ,ወትሪ .carnivory ካልእ categories ካብ ምህላኽ እዮም herbivory (ምብላዕ parts ካብ ),ተኽልታት fungivory (ምብላዕ parts ካብ ),fungi እና detritivory (እቲ ምህላኽ ካብ ምውት organic ናውቲ ()).detritus ኩሎም እዚ ምህላኽ categories ምውዳቅ ትሕቲ እቲ rubric ካብ -consumer-resource .systems እቲ ነገር ይኽእል ኩል ግዘ ኩን ከቢድ ናብ ፍለ ዝተፈላለዩ types ካብ feeding .behaviors ን ,ኣብነት ንእሽተይ parasitic ዓሌታት ግዳይ አብ ልዕሊ ሓደ መዳለዊ organism እና ሽዑ ምውዳቕ ናቶም eggs አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ነገር ን ናቶም offspring ናብ ምምጋብ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ነገር እስካብ እቲ ነገር continues ናብ ንበር አብ ውሽጢ ወይ አብ ልዕሊ ናቱ decaying corpse ድሕሪ እቲ ነገር ኣለዎ .ሞይቱ እቲ መፍትሕ characteristic ካብ predation ዋላኳ ተኾነ እዩ እቲ 'predator's ቕጥታ ፅልዋ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ግዳይ .በዝሒ ህዝቢ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ካልእ ,ኢድ detritivores simply ብላዕ ምውት organic ናውቲ arising ካብ እቲ ሙሽሙሽ ካብ ምውት individuals እና ኣለኒ አይኮንን ቕጥታ ፅልዋ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ """"donor ().organism(s",እንታይ እዩ ሓደ ምትሕብባር አበይ ሓደ predator feeds አብ ልዕሊ ናቱ ?ግዳይ,—,—,—,predation

"A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions. Sometimes the status of great powers is formally recognized in conferences such as the Congress of Vienna or an international structure such as the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States serve as the body's five permanent members). At the same time the status of great powers can be informally recognized in a forum such as the G7 which consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.",403,What is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability to exert its influence on a global scale?,A great power,Germany,China,five,1,"ሓደ ምዑዝ ሓይሊ እዩ ሓደ sovereign ግዝኣት እቲ እዩ recognized ከም ምህላው እቲ ተኽእሎ እና expertise ናብ exert ናቱ ተፅዕኖ አብ ልዕሊ ሓደ ዓለምለኻዊ .መለክዒ ምዑዝ powers characteristically ጥሪት ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት እና ቁጠባዊ ,ጥንካረ ከም ደሓን ከም diplomatic እና ልስሉስ ሓይሊ ,ተፅዕኖ አየናይ ተዝኸዉን ጠንቂ ማእኸል ወይ ንኡስ powers ናብ ሕሰበሉ እቲ ምዑዝ 'powers opinions ቅድሚ taking actions ካብ ናቶም .ወንን ዓለም ለኻዊ relations theorists ኣለኒ posited እቲ ምዑዝ ሓይሊ ኩነታት ይኽእል ኩን characterized ናብ ውሽጢ ሓይሊ ,capabilities spatial ,aspects እና ኩነታት .dimensions ሓደ ሓደ ግዘ እቲ ኩነታት ካብ ምዑዝ powers እዩ formally recognized አብ ውሽጢ conferences ከምዚ ከም እቲ Congress ካብ Vienna ወይ ሓደ ዓለም ለኻዊ ቅርፂ ከምዚ ከም እቲ United Nations ድሕንነት ዋዕላ (,China ,France ,Russia እቲ United Kingdom እና እቲ United States ኣገልገለ ከም እቲ 'body's ሓሙሽተ ቀዋሚ ).members ኣብ እቲ ማዕረ ግዜ እቲ ኩነታት ካብ ምዑዝ powers ይኽእል ኩን informally recognized አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ forum ከምዚ ከም እቲ G7 አየናይ consists ካብ ,Canada ,France ,Germany ,Italy ,Japan እቲ United Kingdom እና እቲ United States ካብ .America",እንታይ እዩ ሓደ sovereign ግዝኣት እቲ እዩ recognized ከም ምህላው እቲ ተኽእሎ ናብ exert ናቱ ተፅዕኖ አብ ልዕሊ ሓደ ዓለምለኻዊ ?መለክዒ,ሓደ ምዑዝ ሓይሊ,Germany,China,ሓሙሽተ
"The cultivation of the domesticated grape began 6,000–8,000 years ago in the Near East. Yeast, one of the earliest domesticated microorganisms, occurs naturally on the skins of grapes, leading to the innovation of alcoholic drinks such as wine. The earliest archeological evidence for a dominant position of wine-making in human culture dates from 8,000 years ago in Georgia. The oldest winery was found in Armenia, dating to around 4000 BC.[citation needed] By the 9th century AD the city of Shiraz was known to produce some of the finest wines in the Middle East. Thus it has been proposed that Syrah red wine is named after Shiraz, a city in Persia where the grape was used to make Shirazi wine.[citation needed] Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics record the cultivation of purple grapes,[citation needed] and history attests to the ancient Greeks, Phoenicians, and Romans growing purple grapes for both eating and wine production[citation needed].

While in the Secretariat of State, Montini and Domenico Tardini were considered as the closest and most influential colleagues of Pope Pius XII, who in 1954 named him Archbishop of Milan, the largest Italian diocese.

In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer.

"The process of making beer is known as brewing. A dedicated building for the making of beer is called a brewery, though beer can be made in the home and has been for much of its history. A company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company. Beer made on a domestic scale for non-commercial reasons is classified as homebrewing regardless of where it is made, though most homebrewed beer is made in the home. Brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries, which from the late 19th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only. However, the UK government relaxed legislation in 1963, followed by Australia in 1972 and the US in 1978, allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby.",407,What is the name of a building that is used in the making of beer?,1978,1963,1972,a brewery,4,"እቲ ከይዲ ካብ making ቢራ እዩ ፍሉጥ ከም .brewing ሓደ ግዱስ ምህናፅ ን እቲ making ካብ ቢራ እዩ ዝተፀወዐ ሓደ ,brewery እኳ ቢራ ይኽእል ኩን ዝተሰርሐ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ገዛ እና ኣለዎ ዝነበረ ን ብዙሕ ካብ ናቱ .ታሪኽ ሓደ ድርጅት እቲ makes ቢራ እዩ ዝተፀወዐ ወይ ሓደ brewery ወይ ሓደ brewing .ድርጅት ቢራ ዝተሰርሐ አብ ልዕሊ ሓደ ዘቤት መለክዒ ን -non-commercial reasons እዩ classified ከም homebrewing ብዘየግድስ ካብ አበይ እቲ ነገር እዩ ,ዝተሰርሐ እኳ ብጥዕሚ homebrewed ቢራ እዩ ዝተሰርሐ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ .ገዛ Brewing ቢራ እዩ ዋና ናብ legislation እና taxation አብ ውሽጢ ምዕቡል ,countries አየናይ ካብ እቲ ረፋድ 19th ዘመን largely restricted brewing ናብ ሓደ ንግዳዊ ስርሒት .ጥራሕ ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ እቲ UK መንግስቲ relaxed legislation አብ ውሽጢ ,1963 followed ብ Australia አብ ውሽጢ 1972 እና እቲ ንሕና አብ ውሽጢ ,1978 allowing homebrewing ናብ ምዃን ሓደ ህቡብ .መሕለፊ ግዜ",እንታይ እዩ እቲ ሽም ካብ ሓደ ምህናፅ እቲ እዩ ዘገልገለ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ making ካብ ?ቢራ,1978,1963,1972,ሓደ brewery
"Affirmative action in the United States tends to focus on issues such as education and employment, specifically granting special consideration to racial minorities, Native Americans, and women who have been historically excluded groups in America. Reports have shown that minorities and women have faced discrimination in schools and businesses for many years and this discrimination produced unfair advantages for whites and males in education and employment. The impetus toward affirmative action is redressing the disadvantages associated with past and present discrimination. Further impetus is a desire to ensure public institutions, such as universities, hospitals, and police forces, are more representative of the populations they serve.",408,Where is affirmative action mostly focusing on education and employment?,Native Americans,many years,America,the United States,4,"Affirmative ተግባር አብ ውሽጢ እቲ United States tends ናብ ቀልቢ ምግባር አብ ልዕሊ ፀገማት ከምዚ ከም ትምህርቲ እና ,ምቑጻር ስራሕ specifically granting ፍሉይ consideration ናብ racial ,minorities መበቆል ,Americans እና ኣንስቲ መን ኣለኒ ዝነበረ historically excluded groups አብ ውሽጢ .America Reports ኣለኒ shown እቲ minorities እና ኣንስቲ ኣለኒ faced ምግላል አብ ውሽጢ schools እና businesses ን ቡዙሕ ዓመታት እና እዚ ምግላል produced unfair advantages ን whites እና males አብ ውሽጢ ትምህርቲ እና .ምቑጻር ስራሕ እቲ impetus ንቕድሚት affirmative ተግባር እዩ redressing እቲ disadvantages ተሓባበረ ምስ ሕሉፍ እና እዋናዊ .ምግላል ርሑቅ impetus እዩ ሓደ ባህጊ ናብ ኣረጋግፅ ህዝባዊ ,institutions ከምዚ ከም ,universities ,hospitals እና ፖሊስ ,forces እዮም ቡዙሕ representative ካብ እቲ populations ንሶም .ኣገልገለ",አበይ እዩ affirmative ተግባር መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ focusing አብ ልዕሊ ትምህርቲ እና ?ምቑጻር ስራሕ,መበቆል Americans,ቡዙሕ ዓመታት,America,እቲ United States

"Orthodox Judaism is the approach to religious Judaism which subscribes to a tradition of mass revelation and adheres to the interpretation and application of the laws and ethics of the Torah as legislated in the Talmudic texts by the Tanaim and Amoraim.

Orthodox Judaism generally includes Modern Orthodox Judaism (אורתודוקסיה מודרנית) and Ultra-Orthodox or Haredi Judaism (יהדות חרדית), but complete within is a wide range of philosophies.

"South Slavic dialects historically formed a continuum.

Due to population migrations, Shtokavian became the most widespread in the western Balkans, intruding westwards into the area previously occupied by Chakavian and Kajkavian (which further blend into Slovenian in the northwest). Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs differ in religion and were historically often part of different cultural circles, although a large part of the nations have lived side by side under foreign overlords.

Shias believe that Imamah is of the Principles of Faith (Usul al-Din).As the verse 4:165 of quran expresses the necessity to the appointment of the prophets; so after the demise of the prophet who will play the role of the prophet; till the people have not any plea against Allah.So the same logic that necessitated the assignment of prophets also is applied for Imamah.That is Allah Must assign someone similar to prophet in his attributes and Ismah as his successor to guide the people without any deviation in religion.

"Copper occurs naturally as native copper and was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record. It has a history of use that is at least 10,000 years old, and estimates of its discovery place it at 9000 BC in the Middle East; a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC. There is evidence that gold and meteoric iron (but not iron smelting) were the only metals used by humans before copper. The history of copper metallurgy is thought to have followed the following sequence: 1) cold working of native copper, 2) annealing, 3) smelting, and 4) the lost wax method. In southeastern Anatolia, all four of these metallurgical techniques appears more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic c. 7500 BC. However, just as agriculture was independently invented in several parts of the world, copper smelting was invented locally in several different places. It was probably discovered independently in China before 2800 BC, in Central America perhaps around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting was invented in 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK at 2280 to 1890 BC. Ötzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300–3200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest his involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led to the discovery of iron smelting. Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.[citation needed]",418,How old was the copper pendant found in Iraq?,China,Michigan,8700,four,3,"ነሓስ ኮነ naturally ከም መበቆል ነሓስ እና ኔሩ ፍሉጥ ናብ ንእሽተይ ካብ እቲ oldest civilizations አብ ልዕሊ .ቅዳሕ እቲ ነገር ኣለዎ ሓደ ታሪኽ ካብ ጥቅሚ እቲ እዩ ኣብ ዝነኣሰ ,10,000 ዓመታት ,ዓብይ እና estimates ካብ ናቱ discovery ቦታ እቲ ነገር ኣብ 9000 BC አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ማእኸል ;ምብራቅ ሓደ ነሓስ pendant ኔሩ ተረኺቡ አብ ውሽጢ northern Iraq እቲ dates ናብ 8700 .BC ኣብቲ እዩ ማስረጃ እቲ ወርቂ እና meteoric ሓፂን (ግን ዘይኮነ ሓፂን )smelting ኔሮም እቲ ጥራሕ metals ዘገልገለ ብ humans ቅድሚ .ነሓስ እቲ ታሪኽ ካብ ነሓስ metallurgy እዩ ሓሳብ ናብ ኣለኒ followed እቲ ምኽታል :ቕደም ስዓብ )1 ቁሪ ምስራሕ ካብ መበቆል ,ነሓስ )2 ,annealing )3 ,smelting እና )4 እቲ ዝጠፈአ wax .ሜላ አብ ውሽጢ southeastern ,Anatolia ኩሎም ዓርባዕተ ካብ እዚ metallurgical techniques appears ቡዙሕ ወይ ዝወሓደ ብተኻታታሊ ኣብ እቲ መጀመርታ ካብ እቲ Neolithic .c 7500 .BC ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ጥራሕ ከም ግብርና ኔሩ independently invented አብ ውሽጢ ቡዙሓት parts ካብ እቲ ,ዓለም ነሓስ smelting ኔሩ invented locally አብ ውሽጢ ቡዙሓት ፍሉይ .ቦታታት እቲ ነገር ኔሩ ናይ ምዃን ዕድል discovered independently አብ ውሽጢ China ቅድሚ 2800 ,BC አብ ውሽጢ Central America ምናልባት አብ ከባቢ 600 ,AD እና አብ ውሽጢ ምዕራብ Africa ብዝዕባ እቲ 9th ወይ 10th ዘመን .AD Investment casting ኔሩ invented አብ ውሽጢ 4500–4000 BC አብ ውሽጢ Southeast Asia እና carbon dating ኣለዎ ዝተመስረተ mining ኣብ Alderley ጫፍ አብ ውሽጢ ,Cheshire UK ኣብ 2280 ናብ 1890 .BC Ötzi እቲ ,Iceman ሓደ ተባዕታይ dated ካብ 3300–3200 ,BC ኔሩ ተረኺቡ ምስ ሓደ axe ምስ ሓደ ነሓስ ርእሲ .%99.7 ;ፅሩይ ላዕሊ levels ካብ arsenic አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ ፀጉሪ ሓሳብ ምቕራብ ናቱ involvement አብ ውሽጢ ነሓስ .smelting ተሞክሮ ምስ ነሓስ ኣለዎ assisted እቲ ዕብየት ካብ ካልእ ;metals አብ ውሽጢ ,ብፍሉይ ነሓስ smelting መረሐ ናብ እቲ discovery ካብ ሓፂን .smelting ምህርቲ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ዓብይ ነሓስ ሕውስዋስ አብ ውሽጢ Michigan እና Wisconsin እዩ dated አብ መንጎ 6000 እና 3000 .BC ተፈጥራዊ ,bronze ሓደ ዓይነት ካብ ነሓስ ዝተሰርሐ ካብ ores ሓፍታም አብ ውሽጢ ,silicon ,arsenic እና ()ሓልሓሊፉ ,tin መጺኡ ናብ ውሽጢ ሓፈሻዊ ጥቅሚ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Balkans አብ ከባቢ 5500 .[BC.[citation ]needed",ከመይ ዓብይ ኔሩ እቲ ነሓስ pendant ተረኺቡ አብ ውሽጢ ?Iraq,China,Michigan,8700,ዓርባዕተ

"In 1636 George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, ruler of the Brunswick-Lüneburg principality of Calenberg, moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692, and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its electors would later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who ruled in Hanover was William IV. Semi-Salic law, which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.

"Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989.

"A capacitor (originally known as a condenser) is a passive two-terminal electrical component used to store electrical energy temporarily in an electric field. The forms of practical capacitors vary widely, but all contain at least two electrical conductors (plates) separated by a dielectric (i.e. an insulator that can store energy by becoming polarized). The conductors can be thin films, foils or sintered beads of metal or conductive electrolyte, etc. The nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity. Materials commonly used as dielectrics include glass, ceramic, plastic film, air, vacuum, paper, mica, and oxide layers. Capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices. Unlike a resistor, an ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy. Instead, a capacitor stores energy in the form of an electrostatic field between its plates.",430,How many conductors are present in a capacitor?,—,at least two,—,two,2,"ሓደ capacitor (originally ፍሉጥ ከም ሓደ )condenser እዩ ሓደ ዝንጉዕ -two-terminal electrical component ዘገልገለ ናብ መኽዝን electrical ጉልበት temporarily አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ electric .ሜዳ እቲ forms ካብ ብተግባር capacitors ይፈላለ ,widely ግን ኩሎም ይሕዝ ኣብ ዝነኣሰ ክልተ electrical conductors ()plates separated ብ ሓደ dielectric (..i.e ሓደ insulator እቲ ይኽእል መኽዝን ጉልበት ብ becoming ).polarized እቲ conductors ይኽእል ኩን ቀጢን ,films foils ወይ sintered beads ካብ ሓጺን ወይ conductive ,electrolyte .ወዘተ እቲ nonconducting dielectric acts ናብ ወስኽ እቲ 'capacitor's ኣኽፍል .ትኽእሎ Materials commonly ዘገልገለ ከም dielectrics ይሓውስ ,ብርጭቆ ,ceramic plastic ,ፊልሚ ,ኣየር ,ህዋ ,ወረቐት ,mica እና oxide .layers Capacitors እዮም widely ዘገልገለ ከም parts ካብ electrical circuits አብ ውሽጢ ቡዙሕ ልሙድ electrical .devices Unlike ሓደ ,resistor ሓደ ተስማዕማዒ capacitor ምግባር ዘይኮነ dissipate .ጉልበት ,ከክንዲ ሓደ capacitor stores ጉልበት አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ፎርም ካብ ሓደ electrostatic ሜዳ አብ መንጎ ናቱ .plates",ከመይ ቡዙሕ conductors እዮም እዋናዊ አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ?capacitor,—,ኣብ ዝነኣሰ ክልተ,—,ክልተ

"Karl Popper was born in Vienna (then in Austria-Hungary) in 1902, to upper middle-class parents. All of Karl Popper's grandparents were Jewish, but the Popper family converted to Lutheranism before Karl was born, and so he received Lutheran baptism. They understood this as part of their cultural assimilation, not as an expression of devout belief. Karl's father Simon Siegmund Carl Popper was a lawyer from Bohemia and a doctor of law at the Vienna University, and mother Jenny Schiff was of Silesian and Hungarian descent. After establishing themselves in Vienna, the Poppers made a rapid social climb in Viennese society: Simon Siegmund Carl became a partner in the law firm of Vienna's liberal Burgomaster Herr Grübl and, after Grübl's death in 1898, Simon took over the business. (Malachi Hacohen records that Herr Grübl's first name was Raimund, after which Karl received his middle name. Popper himself, in his autobiography, erroneously recalls that Herr Grübl's first name was Carl.) His father was a bibliophile who had 12,000–14,000 volumes in his personal library.

"The Heian period (平安時代, Heian jidai?) is the last division of classical Japanese history, running from 794 to 1185. The period is named after the capital city of Heian-kyō, or modern Kyōto. It is the period in Japanese history when Buddhism, Taoism and other Chinese influences were at their height. The Heian period is also considered the peak of the Japanese imperial court and noted for its art, especially poetry and literature. Although the Imperial House of Japan had power on the surface, the real power was in the hands of the Fujiwara clan, a powerful aristocratic family who had intermarried with the imperial family.

"U.S. President Barack Obama has rarely used the term, but in his inaugural address on 20 January 2009, he stated ""Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred."" In March 2009 the Defense Department officially changed the name of operations from ""Global War on Terror"" to ""Overseas Contingency Operation"" (OCO). In March 2009, the Obama administration requested that Pentagon staff members avoid use of the term, instead using ""Overseas Contingency Operation"". Basic objectives of the Bush administration ""war on terror"", such as targeting al Qaeda and building international counterterrorism alliances, remain in place. In December 2012, Jeh Johnson, the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, stated that the military fight will be replaced by a law enforcement operation when speaking at Oxford University, predicting that al Qaeda will be so weakened to be ineffective, and has been ""effectively destroyed"", and thus the conflict will not be an armed conflict under international law. In May 2013, Obama stated that the goal is ""to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America""; which coincided with the U.S. Office of Management and Budget having changed the wording from ""Overseas Contingency Operations"" to ""Countering Violent Extremism"" in 2010.",438,When was the Occupation officially changed to the Global War on Terror?,Pentagon,March 2009,Countering Violent Extremism,Global War on Terror,2,"..U.S ፕረዝደንት Barack Obama ኣለዎ ሓልሓሊፉ ዘገልገለ እቲ ,ቃል ግን አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ inaugural አድራሻ አብ ልዕሊ 20 ጥሪ ,2009 ንሱ stated ""ናትና nation እዩ ኣብ ,ውግእ ተቃራኒ ሓደ -far-reaching መርበብ ሓበሬታ ካብ ዓመጽ እና .""hatred አብ ውሽጢ መጋቢት 2009 እቲ Defense ክፍሊ officially changed እቲ ሽም ካብ operations ካብ ""ዓለምለኻዊ ውግእ አብ ልዕሊ ""Terror ናብ ""Overseas Contingency ""ስርሒት ().OCO አብ ውሽጢ መጋቢት ,2009 እቲ Obama administration requested እቲ Pentagon ሰራሕተኛታት members አወግድ ጥቅሚ ካብ እቲ ,ቃል ከክንዲ using ""Overseas Contingency "".ስርሒት መሰረታዊ objectives ካብ እቲ ቈጥቋጥ administration ""ውግእ አብ ልዕሊ "",terror ከምዚ ከም targeting al Qaeda እና ምህናፅ ዓለም ለኻዊ counterterrorism ,alliances ምፅናሕ አብ ውሽጢ .ቦታ አብ ውሽጢ ታሕሳስ ,2012 Jeh ,Johnson እቲ ሓፈሻዊ Counsel ካብ እቲ ክፍሊ ካብ ,Defense stated እቲ እቲ ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት ባእሲ ንመፃእ ኩን replaced ብ ሓደ ሕጊ enforcement ስርሒት መዓዝ speaking ኣብ Oxford ,ዩኒቨርሲቲ predicting እቲ al Qaeda ንመፃእ ኩን ስለዚ weakened ናብ ኩን ,ineffective እና ኣለዎ ዝነበረ ""effectively "",destroyed እና ስለዝኾነ እቲ ባእሲ ንመፃእ ዘይኮነ ኩን ሓደ armed ባእሲ ትሕቲ ዓለም ለኻዊ .ሕጊ አብ ውሽጢ ተዝኸዉን ,2013 Obama stated እቲ እቲ ሽቶ እዩ ""ናብ dismantle ዝተወሰነ networks ካብ ዓመጸና extremists እቲ ምፍርራሕ "";America አየናይ coincided ምስ እቲ ..U.S ቤት-ፅሕፈት ካብ ምሕደራ እና በጀት ምህላው changed እቲ wording ካብ ""Overseas Contingency ""Operations ናብ ""Countering ዓመጸና ""Extremism አብ ውሽጢ .2010",መዓዝ ኔሩ እቲ ሞያ officially changed ናብ እቲ ዓለምለኻዊ ውግእ አብ ልዕሊ ?Terror,Pentagon,መጋቢት 2009,Countering ዓመጸና Extremism,ዓለምለኻዊ ውግእ አብ ልዕሊ Terror

"Throughout their history, the Liberals have been in electoral terms largely the party of the middle class (whom Menzies, in the era of the party's formation called ""The forgotten people""), though such class-based voting patterns are no longer as clear as they once were. In the 1970s a left-wing middle class emerged that no longer voted Liberal.[citation needed] One effect of this was the success of a breakaway party, the Australian Democrats, founded in 1977 by former Liberal minister Don Chipp and members of minor liberal parties; other members of the left-leaning section of the middle-class became Labor supporters.[citation needed] On the other hand, the Liberals have done increasingly well in recent years among socially conservative working-class voters.[citation needed]However the Liberal Party's key support base remains the upper-middle classes; 16 of the 20 richest federal electorates are held by the Liberals, most of which are safe seats.

"In an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material (detritus)). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the ""donor"" organism(s).",442,Predation is what in an ecosystem?,a biological interaction,—,—,—,1,"አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ,ecosystem predation እዩ ሓደ biological ምትሕብባር አበይ ሓደ predator (ሓደ organism እቲ እዩ )hunting feeds አብ ልዕሊ ናቱ ግዳይ (እቲ organism እቲ እዩ ).attacked Predators ተዝኸዉን ወይ ተዝኸዉን ዘይኮነ ምቕታል ናቶም ግዳይ ቅድሚያ ናብ feeding አብ ልዕሊ ,ንሶም ግን እቲ ፍፃመ ካብ predation ኩል ግዘ ውፅኢታት አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ሞት ካብ እቲ ግዳይ እና እቲ eventual absorption ካብ እቲ 'prey's ቲሹ ብውሽጢ .ምህላኽ ስለዝኾነ predation እዩ ,ኩል ግዘ እኳ ዘይኮነ ,ወትሪ .carnivory ካልእ categories ካብ ምህላኽ እዮም herbivory (ምብላዕ parts ካብ ),ተኽልታት fungivory (ምብላዕ parts ካብ ),fungi እና detritivory (እቲ ምህላኽ ካብ ምውት organic ናውቲ ()).detritus ኩሎም እዚ ምህላኽ categories ምውዳቅ ትሕቲ እቲ rubric ካብ -consumer-resource .systems እቲ ነገር ይኽእል ኩል ግዘ ኩን ከቢድ ናብ ፍለ ዝተፈላለዩ types ካብ feeding .behaviors ን ,ኣብነት ንእሽተይ parasitic ዓሌታት ግዳይ አብ ልዕሊ ሓደ መዳለዊ organism እና ሽዑ ምውዳቕ ናቶም eggs አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ነገር ን ናቶም offspring ናብ ምምጋብ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ነገር እስካብ እቲ ነገር continues ናብ ንበር አብ ውሽጢ ወይ አብ ልዕሊ ናቱ decaying corpse ድሕሪ እቲ ነገር ኣለዎ .ሞይቱ እቲ መፍትሕ characteristic ካብ predation ዋላኳ ተኾነ እዩ እቲ 'predator's ቕጥታ ፅልዋ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ግዳይ .በዝሒ ህዝቢ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ካልእ ,ኢድ detritivores simply ብላዕ ምውት organic ናውቲ arising ካብ እቲ ሙሽሙሽ ካብ ምውት individuals እና ኣለኒ አይኮንን ቕጥታ ፅልዋ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ """"donor ().organism(s",Predation እዩ እንታይ አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ?ecosystem,ሓደ biological ምትሕብባር,—,—,—

"Moreover, a conflict of interest between professional investment managers and their institutional clients, combined with a global glut in investment capital, led to bad investments by asset managers in over-priced credit assets. Professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client assets under management. There is, therefore, an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation. As the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline, asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients. Many asset managers chose to continue to invest client funds in over-priced (under-yielding) investments, to the detriment of their clients, in order to maintain their assets under management. This choice was supported by a ""plausible deniability"" of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early ""vintages"" of subprime loans was so low.",455,What is the role of asset managers that are compensated based on volume of client assets under management?,—,—,Professional investment managers,—,3,",ካብዚ ብተወሳኺ ሓደ ባእሲ ካብ ወለድ አብ መንጎ በዓል ልምዲ investment managers እና ናቶም institutional ,clients combined ምስ ሓደ ዓለምለኻዊ glut አብ ውሽጢ investment ,ሃብቲ መረሐ ናብ ሕማቅ investments ብ ጥሪት managers አብ ውሽጢ -over-priced ልቓሕ .ሃብቲ በዓል ልምዲ investment managers ብሓፈሻ እዮም compensated መሰረት ዝገበረ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ትሕዝቶ ካብ ዓሚል ሃብቲ ትሕቲ .ምሕደራ ኣብቲ ,እዩ ,ስለዚ ድማ ሓደ መተባብዒ ን ጥሪት managers ናብ ምስፍሕፋሕ ናቶም ሃብቲ ትሕቲ ምሕደራ አብ ውሽጢ ስርዓት ናብ maximize ናቶም .compensation ከም እቲ glut አብ ውሽጢ ዓለምለኻዊ investment ሃብቲ caused እቲ yields አብ ልዕሊ ልቓሕ ሃብቲ ናብ ,ኣውድቅ ጥሪት managers ኔሮም faced ምስ እቲ ምርጫ ካብ ወይ investing አብ ውሽጢ ሃብቲ አበይ returns ግቡር ዘይኮነ ኣንጸባርቕ ሓቂ ልቓሕ ሓደጋ ወይ returning funds ናብ .clients ቡዙሕ ጥሪት managers chose ናብ ቀፃሊ ናብ ወፍሪ ዓሚል funds አብ ውሽጢ -over-priced (-)under-yielding ,investments ናብ እቲ detriment ካብ ናቶም ,clients አብ ውሽጢ ስርዓት ናብ ምዕቃብ ናቶም ሃብቲ ትሕቲ .ምሕደራ እዚ ምርጫ ኔሩ supported ብ ሓደ ""plausible ""deniability ካብ እቲ risks ተሓባበረ ምስ -subprime-based ልቓሕ ሃብቲ ምኽንያቱ እቲ ምስኣን ተሞክሮ ምስ ብግዘ """"vintages ካብ subprime loans ኔሩ ስለዚ .ውሑድ",እንታይ እዩ እቲ ግደ ካብ ጥሪት managers እቲ እዮም compensated መሰረት ዝገበረ አብ ልዕሊ ትሕዝቶ ካብ ዓሚል ሃብቲ ትሕቲ ?ምሕደራ,—,—,በዓል ልምዲ investment managers,—

"Circadian rhythms allow organisms to anticipate and prepare for precise and regular environmental changes. They thus enable organisms to best capitalize on environmental resources (e.g. light and food) compared to those that cannot predict such availability. It has therefore been suggested that circadian rhythms put organisms at a selective advantage in evolutionary terms. However, rhythmicity appears to be as important in regulating and coordinating internal metabolic processes, as in coordinating with the environment. This is suggested by the maintenance (heritability) of circadian rhythms in fruit flies after several hundred generations in constant laboratory conditions, as well as in creatures in constant darkness in the wild, and by the experimental elimination of behavioral, but not physiological, circadian rhythms in quail.",460,What kind of rhythms do organisms use to anticipate and prepare for environmental changes?,—,—,Circadian,several hundred,3,"Circadian rhythms ፍቀድ organisms ናብ ግምት እና ተዳሎ ን ምጽግጋዕ እና ልሙድ environmental .changes ንሶም ስለዝኾነ ኣኽእል organisms ናብ ምሩፅ capitalize አብ ልዕሊ environmental ምንጭታት (..e.g ብርሃን እና )ምግቢ compared ናብ እቲኦም እቲ cannot ምትንባይ ከምዚ .availability እቲ ነገር ኣለዎ ስለዚ ድማ ዝነበረ suggested እቲ circadian rhythms አቅምጥ organisms ኣብ ሓደ selective ጥቅሚ አብ ውሽጢ evolutionary .ስያመታት ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ rhythmicity appears ናብ ኩን ከም ጠቃሚ አብ ውሽጢ regulating እና coordinating ውሽጣዊ metabolic ,processes ከም አብ ውሽጢ coordinating ምስ እቲ .ከባቢ እዚ እዩ suggested ብ እቲ ፅገና ()heritability ካብ circadian rhythms አብ ውሽጢ ፍረ flies ድሕሪ ቡዙሓት ሚእቲ generations አብ ውሽጢ ቀዋሚ laboratory ,ኩነታት ከም ደሓን ከም አብ ውሽጢ creatures አብ ውሽጢ ቀዋሚ darkness አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ,ልቂ እና ብ እቲ experimental elimination ካብ ,behavioral ግን ዘይኮነ ,physiological circadian rhythms አብ ውሽጢ .quail",እንታይ ርህሩህ ካብ rhythms ግበር organisms ጥቅሚ ናብ ግምት እና ተዳሎ ን environmental ?changes,—,—,Circadian,ቡዙሓት ሚእቲ

"In the human digestive system, food enters the mouth and mechanical digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work. After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall.

"Puberty occurs through a long process and begins with a surge in hormone production, which in turn causes a number of physical changes. It is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics (for example, a deeper voice and larger adam's apple in boys, and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the pituitary gland, which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction to occur. The male and female gonads are subsequently activated, which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals. The testes primarily release testosterone, and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen. The production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met.

"Physically, database servers are dedicated computers that hold the actual databases and run only the DBMS and related software. Database servers are usually multiprocessor computers, with generous memory and RAID disk arrays used for stable storage. RAID is used for recovery of data if any of the disks fail. Hardware database accelerators, connected to one or more servers via a high-speed channel, are also used in large volume transaction processing environments. DBMSs are found at the heart of most database applications. DBMSs may be built around a custom multitasking kernel with built-in networking support, but modern DBMSs typically rely on a standard operating system to provide these functions. from databases before the inception of Structured Query Language (SQL).

Most infections do not have symptoms, known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term ""consumption"" came about due to the weight loss.

"In the human digestive system, food enters the mouth and mechanical digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work. After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes.",475,What liquid is secreted by the salivary glands?,Gastric,Saliva,pepsin,two,2,"አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ሰብ digestive ,ስርዓት ምግቢ enters እቲ ኣፍ እና mechanical digestion ካብ እቲ ምግቢ starts ብ እቲ ተግባር ካብ mastication (),chewing ሓደ ፎርም ካብ mechanical ,digestion እና እቲ wetting መርከቢ ካብ .saliva ,Saliva ሓደ ፈሳሲ secreted ብ እቲ salivary ,glands የጠቓልል salivary ,amylase ሓደ enzyme አየናይ starts እቲ digestion ካብ starch አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ;ምግቢ እቲ saliva እውን የጠቓልል ,mucus አየናይ lubricates እቲ ,ምግቢ እና hydrogen ,carbonate አየናይ provides እቲ ተስማዕማዒ ኩነታት ካብ pH ()alkaline ን amylase ናብ .ስራሕ ድሕሪ undergoing mastication እና starch ,digestion እቲ ምግቢ ንመፃእ ኩን አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ፎርም ካብ ሓደ ,ንኡስ ዓንኬል slurry መጠን ኣካል ዝተፀወዐ ሓደ .bolus እቲ ነገር ንመፃእ ሽዑ ምጉዓዝ ታሕቲ እቲ esophagus እና ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ ከብዲ ብ እቲ ተግባር ካብ .peristalsis Gastric ጽሟቕ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ከብዲ starts protein .digestion Gastric ጽሟቕ mainly የጠቓልል hydrochloric acid እና .pepsin ከም እዚ ክልተ chemicals ተዝኸዉን ጉድኣት እቲ ከብዲ ,መንደቅ mucus እዩ secreted ብ እቲ ,ከብዲ providing ሓደ slimy ሽፋን እቲ acts ከም ሓደ ዋልታ ተቃራኒ እቲ damaging effects ካብ እቲ .chemicals ኣብ እቲ ማዕረ ግዜ protein digestion እዩ ,occurring mechanical mixing ኮነ ብ ,peristalsis አየናይ እዩ waves ካብ muscular contractions እቲ ምንቅስቓስ ማዕረ ኣንፈት እቲ ከብዲ .መንደቅ እዚ allows እቲ መጠን ኣካል ካብ ምግቢ ናብ ርሑቅ mix ምስ እቲ digestive .enzymes",እንታይ ፈሳሲ እዩ secreted ብ እቲ salivary ?glands,Gastric,Saliva,pepsin,ክልተ

"Founded in 1670 as Charles Town in honor of King Charles II of England, Charleston adopted its present name in 1783. It moved to its present location on Oyster Point in 1680 from a location on the west bank of the Ashley River known as Albemarle Point.

"The British high-definition TV service started trials in August 1936 and a regular service on 2 November 1936 using both the (mechanical) Baird 240 line sequential scan (later to be inaccurately rechristened 'progressive') and the (electronic) Marconi-EMI 405 line interlaced systems. The Baird system was discontinued in February 1937. In 1938 France followed with their own 441-line system, variants of which were also used by a number of other countries. The US NTSC 525-line system joined in 1941. In 1949 France introduced an even higher-resolution standard at 819 lines, a system that should have been high definition even by today's standards, but was monochrome only and the technical limitations of the time prevented it from achieving the definition of which it should have been capable. All of these systems used interlacing and a 4:3 aspect ratio except the 240-line system which was progressive (actually described at the time by the technically correct term ""sequential"") and the 405-line system which started as 5:4 and later changed to 4:3. The 405-line system adopted the (at that time) revolutionary idea of interlaced scanning to overcome the flicker problem of the 240-line with its 25 Hz frame rate. The 240-line system could have doubled its frame rate but this would have meant that the transmitted signal would have doubled in bandwidth, an unacceptable option as the video baseband bandwidth was required to be not more than 3 MHz.",480,When did the British high-definition TV service start trials?,August 1936,more than 3,Baird,525,1,"እቲ British -high-definition TV ግልጋሎት ተጀሚሩ trials አብ ውሽጢ ነሓሰ 1936 እና ሓደ ልሙድ ግልጋሎት አብ ልዕሊ 2 ሕዳር 1936 using ክልቲኡ እቲ ()mechanical Baird 240 መስመር sequential scan (ዳሕራይ ናብ ኩን inaccurately rechristened '')progressive እና እቲ ()electronic -Marconi-EMI 405 መስመር interlaced .systems እቲ Baird ስርዓት ኔሩ discontinued አብ ውሽጢ ለካቲት .1937 አብ ውሽጢ 1938 France followed ምስ ናቶም ወንን -441-line ,ስርዓት variants ካብ አየናይ ኔሮም እውን ዘገልገለ ብ ሓደ ቑጽሪ ካብ ካልእ .countries እቲ ንሕና NTSC -525-line ስርዓት joined አብ ውሽጢ .1941 አብ ውሽጢ 1949 France introduced ሓደ ሙሉእ -higher-resolution መለክዒ ኣብ 819 ,lines ሓደ ስርዓት እቲ ይሓይሽ ኣለኒ ዝነበረ ላዕሊ ኣገላልፃ ሙሉእ ብ 'today's ,standards ግን ኔሩ monochrome ጥራሕ እና እቲ technical limitations ካብ እቲ ግዜ prevented እቲ ነገር ካብ achieving እቲ ኣገላልፃ ካብ አየናይ እቲ ነገር ይሓይሽ ኣለኒ ዝነበረ .ተኽእሎ ዘለዎ ኩሎም ካብ እዚ systems ዘገልገለ interlacing እና ሓደ :4:3 ገጽታ መጠነ ዝምድና ብዘይካ እቲ -240-line ስርዓት አየናይ ኔሩ progressive (ብሓቂ described ኣብ እቲ ግዜ ብ እቲ technically ልክዕ ቃል """")sequential እና እቲ -405-line ስርዓት አየናይ ተጀሚሩ ከም :5:4 እና ዳሕራይ changed ናብ :.4:3 እቲ -405-line ስርዓት adopted እቲ (ኣብ እቲ )ግዜ revolutionary ሓሳብ ካብ interlaced scanning ናብ ተቈፃፀረ እቲ flicker ፀገም ካብ እቲ -240-line ምስ ናቱ 25 Hz መቓን .መደብ እቲ -240-line ስርዓት ይከኣል ኣለኒ doubled ናቱ መቓን መደብ ግን እዚ ይኸውን ኣለኒ ናይ ብሓቂ እቲ እቲ transmitted signal ይኸውን ኣለኒ doubled አብ ውሽጢ ,bandwidth ሓደ unacceptable መማረጺ ከም እቲ ቪዲዮ baseband bandwidth ኔሩ ዘድሊ ናብ ኩን ዘይኮነ ቡዙሕ ካብ 3 .MHz",መዓዝ ግቡር እቲ British -high-definition TV ግልጋሎት ጀምር ?trials,ነሓሰ 1936,ቡዙሕ ካብ 3,Baird,525

In 1724, Mughal viceroy Asif Jah I declared his sovereignty and created his own dynasty, known as the Nizams of Hyderabad. The Nizam's dominions became a princely state during the British Raj, and remained so for 150 years, with the city serving as its capital. The Nizami influence can still be seen in the culture of the Hyderabadi Muslims. The city continued as the capital of Hyderabad State after it was brought into the Indian Union in 1948, and became the capital of Andhra Pradesh after the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. Since 1956, Rashtrapati Nilayam in the city has been the winter office of the President of India.

"The Alps (/ælps/; Italian: Alpi [ˈalpi]; French: Alpes [alp]; German: Alpen [ˈʔalpm̩]; Slovene: Alpe [ˈáːlpɛ]) are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The Caucasus Mountains are higher, and the Urals longer, but both lie partly in Asia. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the French–Italian border, and at 4,810 m (15,781 ft) is the highest mountain in the Alps.

"The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.",486,What serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals?,15–33 billion,—,several thousand,The brain,4,"እቲ ሓንጎል እዩ ሓደ organ እቲ serves ከም እቲ ማእኸል ካብ እቲ ድንጉፅ ስርዓት አብ ውሽጢ ኩሎም vertebrate እና ብጥዕሚ invertebrate .animals ጥራሕ ሓደ ቁሩብ invertebrates ከምዚ ከም ,sponges ,jellyfish adult ባሕሪ squirts እና starfish ግበር ዘይኮነ ኣለኒ ሓደ ;ሓንጎል diffuse ወይ localised nerve nets እዮም እዋናዊ .ከክንዲ እቲ ሓንጎል እዩ located አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ,ርእሲ ብልሙድ ዕፁው ናብ እቲ ቀዳማይ sensory organs ን ከምዚ senses ከም ,ራእይ ,hearing ,ሚዛን ,ጣዕሚ እና .ጨና እቲ ሓንጎል እዩ እቲ ብጥዕሚ ሕውስዋስ organ አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ 'vertebrate's .ሰውነት አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ዝተለመደ ,ሰብ እቲ cerebral cortex (እቲ largest )ክፋል እዩ ይግመት ናብ ይሕዝ 15–33 billion ,neurons ሕድሕድ connected ብ synapses ናብ ቡዙሓት ሽሕ ካልእ .neurons እዚ neurons ምርድዳእ ምስ ሓደ ካልእ ብ ማለት ካብ ነዊሕ protoplasmic fibers ዝተፀወዐ ,axons አየናይ ተሸከም trains ካብ signal pulses ዝተፀወዐ ተግባር potentials ናብ distant parts ካብ እቲ ሓንጎል ወይ ሰውነት targeting ዝተወሰነ recipient .cells",እንታይ serves ከም እቲ ማእኸል ካብ እቲ ድንጉፅ ስርዓት አብ ውሽጢ ኩሎም vertebrate እና ብጥዕሚ invertebrate ?animals,15–33 billion,—,ቡዙሓት ሽሕ,እቲ ሓንጎል

"Cubism began between 1907 and 1911. Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon has often been considered a proto-Cubist work. Georges Braque's 1908 Houses at L’Estaque (and related works) prompted the critic Louis Vauxcelles to refer to bizarreries cubiques (cubic oddities). Gertrude Stein referred to landscapes made by Picasso in 1909, such as Reservoir at Horta de Ebro, as the first Cubist paintings. The first organized group exhibition by Cubists took place at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris during the spring of 1911 in a room called 'Salle 41'; it included works by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and Henri Le Fauconnier, yet no works by Picasso or Braque were exhibited.",488,Who said that the first Cubist paintings made by Picasso were made?,Gertrude Stein,Reservoir,Les Demoiselles d'Avignon,Georges Braque's,1,"Cubism ጀሚሩ አብ መንጎ 1907 እና .1911 Pablo 'Picasso's 1907 ስእሊ Les Demoiselles 'd'Avignon ኣለዎ ኩል ግዘ ዝነበረ ገምገመ ሓደ -proto-Cubist .ስራሕ Georges 'Braque's 1908 Houses ኣብ L’Estaque (እና ዝተኣሳሰረ )works prompted እቲ critic Louis Vauxcelles ናብ ምራሕ ናብ bizarreries cubiques (cubic ).oddities Gertrude Stein referred ናብ landscapes ዝተሰርሐ ብ Picasso አብ ውሽጢ ,1909 ከምዚ ከም Reservoir ኣብ Horta de ,Ebro ከም እቲ መጀመርታ Cubist .paintings እቲ መጀመርታ organized ጉጅለ ምርኢት ብ Cubists ምውሳድ ቦታ ኣብ እቲ Salon des Indépendants አብ ውሽጢ Paris አብ እዋን እቲ ፅድያ ካብ 1911 አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ክፍሊ ዝተፀወዐ 'Salle ';41 እቲ ነገር included works ብ Jean ,Metzinger Albert ,Gleizes Fernand ,Léger Robert Delaunay እና Henri Le ,Fauconnier እስካብ ዛሕዚ አይኮንን works ብ Picasso ወይ Braque ኔሮም .exhibited",መን ኢሉ እቲ እቲ መጀመርታ Cubist paintings ዝተሰርሐ ብ Picasso ኔሮም ?ዝተሰርሐ,Gertrude Stein,Reservoir,Les Demoiselles 'd'Avignon,Georges 'Braque's

"Nigeria is often referred to as the ""Giant of Africa"", owing to its large population and economy. With approximately 182 million inhabitants, Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and the seventh most populous country in the world. Nigeria has one of the largest populations of youth in the world.

"In February 1907, the Royal Dutch Shell Group was created through the amalgamation of two rival companies: the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company of the Netherlands and the ""Shell"" Transport and Trading Company Ltd of the United Kingdom. It was a move largely driven by the need to compete globally with Standard Oil. The Royal Dutch Petroleum Company was a Dutch company founded in 1890 to develop an oilfield in Sumatra, and initially led by August Kessler, Hugo Loudon, and Henri Deterding. The ""Shell"" Transport and Trading Company (the quotation marks were part of the legal name) was a British company, founded in 1897 by Marcus Samuel, 1st Viscount Bearsted, and his brother Samuel Samuel.

"Affirmative action in the United States tends to focus on issues such as education and employment, specifically granting special consideration to racial minorities, Native Americans, and women who have been historically excluded groups in America. Reports have shown that minorities and women have faced discrimination in schools and businesses for many years and this discrimination produced unfair advantages for whites and males in education and employment. The impetus toward affirmative action is redressing the disadvantages associated with past and present discrimination.

"Upon his election to the papacy, Montini took the pontifical name Paul VI (the first to take the name ""Paul"" since 1605) to indicate a renewed worldwide mission to spread the message of Christ, following the example of Apostle St. Paul.[citation needed] He re-convened the Second Vatican Council, which was automatically closed with the death of John XXIII, and gave it priority and direction. After the council had concluded its work, Paul VI took charge of the interpretation and implementation of its mandates, often walking a thin line between the conflicting expectations of various groups within Catholicism. The magnitude and depth of the reforms affecting all fields of Church life during his pontificate exceeded similar reform policies of his predecessors and successors. Paul VI was a Marian devotee, speaking repeatedly to Marian congresses and mariological meetings, visiting Marian shrines and issuing three Marian encyclicals. Following his famous predecessor Saint Ambrose of Milan, he named Mary as the Mother of the Church during the Second Vatican Council. Paul VI sought dialogue with the world, with other Christians, other religions, and atheists, excluding nobody. He saw himself as a humble servant for a suffering humanity and demanded significant changes of the rich in North America and Europe in favour of the poor in the Third World. His positions on birth control, promulgated most famously in the 1968 encyclical Humanae vitae, and other political issues, were often controversial, especially in Western Europe and North America.",496,Who was the first person to take the pontifical name Paul VI?,Montini,1605,three,Western Europe,1,"ኣብ ግዘ ናቱ election ናብ እቲ ,papacy Montini ምውሳድ እቲ pontifical ሽም Paul VI (እቲ መጀመርታ ናብ ውሰድ እቲ ሽም """"Paul ካብ )1605 ናብ ምምልካት ሓደ renewed worldwide ተልእኾ ናብ ምዝርጋሕ እቲ መልእኽቲ ካብ ,Christ ምኽታል እቲ ኣብነት ካብ Apostle .ቅዱስ .[Paul.[citation ]needed ንሱ -re-convened እቲ ካልኣይ Vatican ,ዋዕላ አየናይ ኔሩ automatically closed ምስ እቲ ሞት ካብ John ,XXIII እና ሂቡ እቲ ነገር ቀዳምነት እና .ኣንፈት ድሕሪ እቲ ዋዕላ ዝነበረ concluded ናቱ ,ስራሕ Paul VI ምውሳድ ኣኽፍል ካብ እቲ interpretation እና implementation ካብ ናቱ ,mandates ኩል ግዘ ምኻድ ሓደ ቀጢን መስመር አብ መንጎ እቲ conflicting expectations ካብ ዝተፈላለዩ groups አብ ውሽጢ .Catholicism እቲ magnitude እና ዕምቈት ካብ እቲ reforms affecting ኩሎም fields ካብ ቤተ ክርስትያን ህይወት አብ እዋን ናቱ pontificate exceeded ተመሳሳሊ reform policies ካብ ናቱ predecessors እና .successors Paul VI ኔሩ ሓደ Marian ,devotee speaking repeatedly ናብ Marian congresses እና mariological ,meetings visiting Marian shrines እና issuing ሰለስተ Marian .encyclicals ምኽታል ናቱ ተፈላጢ predecessor Saint Ambrose ካብ ,Milan ንሱ named Mary ከም እቲ ኣዶ ካብ እቲ ቤተ ክርስትያን አብ እዋን እቲ ካልኣይ Vatican .ዋዕላ Paul VI ድሌት dialogue ምስ እቲ ,ዓለም ምስ ካልእ ,Christians ካልእ ,religions እና ,atheists excluding .ዋላ ሓደ ንሱ ሪኤ himself ከም ሓደ ትሑት servant ን ሓደ ይሳቐ humanity እና demanded ግዙፍ changes ካብ እቲ ሓፍታም አብ ውሽጢ ሰሜን America እና Europe አብ ውሽጢ ፍትወት ካብ እቲ ድኻ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ሳልሳይ .ዓለም ናቱ positions አብ ልዕሊ birth ,ምቁጽጻር promulgated ብጥዕሚ famously አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 1968 encyclical Humanae ,vitae እና ካልእ political ,ፀገማት ኔሮም ኩል ግዘ ,ዘከራኽር ብፍላይ አብ ውሽጢ Western Europe እና ሰሜን .America",መን ኔሩ እቲ መጀመርታ ሰብ ናብ ውሰድ እቲ pontifical ሽም Paul ?VI,Montini,1605,ሰለስተ,Western Europe

"All the objects from everyday life that we can bump into, touch or squeeze are composed of atoms. This atomic matter is in turn made up of interacting subatomic particles—usually a nucleus of protons and neutrons, and a cloud of orbiting electrons. Typically, science considers these composite particles matter because they have both rest mass and volume. By contrast, massless particles, such as photons, are not considered matter, because they have neither rest mass nor volume. However, not all particles with rest mass have a classical volume, since fundamental particles such as quarks and leptons (sometimes equated with matter) are considered ""point particles"" with no effective size or volume. Nevertheless, quarks and leptons together make up ""ordinary matter"", and their interactions contribute to the effective volume of the composite particles that make up ordinary matter.",498,What do scientists call objects from everyday life composed of?,free radical.n.01,atoms,chylomicron.n.01,monad.n.01,2,"ኩሎም እቲ objects ካብ everyday ህይወት እቲ ንሕና ይኽእል ምጉርምራም ,ናብ ውሽጢ ምንካእ ወይ ምጽሟቕ እዮም composed ካብ .atoms እዚ atomic ነገር እዩ አብ ውሽጢ ተጠወ ዝተሰርሐ ሓፍ ካብ interacting subatomic particles—usually ሓደ nucleus ካብ protons እና ,neutrons እና ሓደ ደበና ካብ orbiting .electrons ,Typically ሳይንስ considers እዚ composite particles ነገር ምኽንያቱ ንሶም ኣለኒ ክልቲኡ ዕረፍቲ መጠን ኣካል እና .ትሕዝቶ ብ ,ኣወዳደረ massless ,particles ከምዚ ከም ,photons እዮም ዘይኮነ ገምገመ ,ነገር ምኽንያቱ ንሶም ኣለኒ ዋላ ዕረፍቲ መጠን ኣካል እውን ኣይኮነን .ትሕዝቶ ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ዘይኮነ ኩሎም particles ምስ ዕረፍቲ መጠን ኣካል ኣለኒ ሓደ classical ,ትሕዝቶ ካብ መሰረታዊ particles ከምዚ ከም quarks እና leptons (ሓደ ሓደ ግዘ equated ምስ )ነገር እዮም ገምገመ ""ነጥቢ ""particles ምስ አይኮንን ውፅኢታዊ ግዝፊ ወይ .ትሕዝቶ ,ምንም ብዘየገድስ quarks እና leptons ብሓባር ስራሕ ሓፍ ""ተራ "",ነገር እና ናቶም interactions ኣዋፅእ ናብ እቲ ውፅኢታዊ ትሕዝቶ ካብ እቲ composite particles እቲ ስራሕ ሓፍ ተራ .ነገር",እንታይ ግበር ሳይንቲስት ደውል objects ካብ everyday ህይወት composed ?ካብ,ነፃ ..radical.n.01,atoms,..chylomicron.n.01,..monad.n.01

"The Saxon and Austrian armies were unprepared, and their forces were scattered. Frederick occupied Dresden with little or no opposition from the Saxons. At the Battle of Lobositz on 1 October 1756, Frederick prevented the isolated Saxon army from being reinforced by an Austrian army under General Browne. The Prussians then occupied Saxony; after the Siege of Pirna, the Saxon army surrendered in October 1756, and was forcibly incorporated into the Prussian army. The attack on neutral Saxony caused outrage across Europe and led to the strengthening of the anti-Prussian coalition. The only significant Austrian success was the partial occupation of Silesia. Far from being easy, Frederick's early successes proved indecisive and very costly for Prussia's smaller army. This led him to remark that he did not fight the same Austrians as he had during the previous war.",6,How did Frederick describe his early successes against the Austrians according to the passage?,Decisive and low-cost,Indecisive and costly,Overwhelmingly victorious,Not worth the effort,2,"እቲ Saxon እና Austrian armies ኔሮም ,unprepared እና ናቶም forces ኔሮም .ዝተበታተነ Frederick ብስራሕ ትሑዝ Dresden ምስ ንእሽተይ ወይ አይኮንን opposition ካብ እቲ .Saxons ኣብ እቲ ውግእ ካብ Lobositz አብ ልዕሊ 1 ጥቅምቲ ,1756 Frederick prevented እቲ ዝተገለለ Saxon ሰራዊት ካብ ፍጥረት reinforced ብ ሓደ Austrian ሰራዊት ትሕቲ ሓፈሻዊ .Browne እቲ Prussians ሽዑ ብስራሕ ትሑዝ ;Saxony ድሕሪ እቲ Siege ካብ ,Pirna እቲ Saxon ሰራዊት surrendered አብ ውሽጢ ጥቅምቲ ,1756 እና ኔሩ forcibly incorporated ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ Prussian .ሰራዊት እቲ መጥቃዕቲ አብ ልዕሊ ግሉል Saxony caused outrage ሰገር Europe እና መረሐ ናብ እቲ strengthening ካብ እቲ -anti-Prussian .coalition እቲ ጥራሕ ግዙፍ Austrian ዓወት ኔሩ እቲ partial ሞያ ካብ .Silesia ርሑቅ ካብ ፍጥረት ,ቀሊል 'Frederick's ብግዘ successes proved indecisive እና ብጣዕሚ costly ን 'Prussia's smaller .ሰራዊት እዚ መረሐ ንሱ ናብ remark እቲ ንሱ ግቡር ዘይኮነ ባእሲ እቲ ማዕረ Austrians ከም ንሱ ዝነበረ አብ እዋን እቲ ዝሓለፈ .ውግእ",ከመይ ግቡር Frederick ግለፅ ናቱ ብግዘ successes ተቃራኒ እቲ Austrians ከም ናብ እቲ ?መሕለፊ,Decisive እና -low-cost,Indecisive እና costly,Overwhelmingly victorious,ዘይኮነ ዋጋ እቲ ፃዕሪ
"Herds of red and fallow deer also roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer, which can frequently be seen in herds to the north of the Forest.
