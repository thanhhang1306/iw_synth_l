"The Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East. The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066.

"At age eight, Beyoncé and childhood friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group. They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group.

They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group.

"On April 4, 2008, Beyoncé married Jay Z. She publicly revealed their marriage in a video montage at the listening party for her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, in Manhattan's Sony Club on October 22, 2008. I Am... Sasha Fierce was released on November 18, 2008 in the United States. The album formally introduces Beyoncé's alter ego Sasha Fierce, conceived during the making of her 2003single 'Crazy in Love', selling 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyoncé her third consecutive number-one album in the US. The album featured the number-one song 'Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)' and the top-five songs 'If I Were a Boy' and 'Halo'. Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, 'Halo's success in the US helped Beyoncé attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful 'Sweet Dreams', and singles 'Diva', 'Ego', 'Broken-Hearted Girl' and 'Video Phone'. The music video for 'Single Ladies' has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the 'first major dance craze' of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star. The video has won several awards, including Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 2009 Scottish MOBO Awards, and the 2009 BET Awards. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for nine awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American country pop singer Taylor Swift's 'You Belong with Me', led to Kanye West interrupting the ceremony and Beyoncé improvising a re-presentation of Swift's award during her own acceptance speech.

Sasha Fierce, in Manhattan's Sony Club on October 22, 2008. I Am... Sasha Fierce was released on November 18, 2008 in the United States. The album formally introduces Beyoncé's alter ego Sasha Fierce, conceived during the making of her 2003single 'Crazy in Love', selling 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyoncé her third consecutive number-one album in the US. The album featured the number-one song 'Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)' and the top-five songs 'If I Were a Boy' and 'Halo'. Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, 'Halo's success in the US helped Beyoncé attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful 'Sweet Dreams', and singles 'Diva', 'Ego', 'Broken-Hearted Girl' and 'Video Phone'. The music video for 'Single Ladies' has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the 'first major dance craze' of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star.

At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for nine awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American country pop singer Taylor Swift's 'You Belong with Me', led to Kanye West interrupting the ceremony and Beyoncé improvising a re-presentation of Swift's award during her own acceptance speech.

"Beyoncé further expanded her acting career, starring as blues singer Etta James in the 2008 musical biopic, Cadillac Records. Her performance in the film received praise from critics, and she garnered several nominations for her portrayal of James, including a Satellite Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and a NAACP Image Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress. Beyoncé donated her entire salary from the film to Phoenix House, an organization of rehabilitation centers for heroin addicts around the country. On January 20, 2009, Beyoncé performed James' \'At Last\' at the First Couple's first inaugural ball. Beyoncé starred opposite Ali Larter and Idris Elba in the thriller, Obsessed.

Beyoncé donated her entire salary from the film to Phoenix House, an organization of rehabilitation centers for heroin addicts around the country. On January 20, 2009, Beyoncé performed James' \'At Last\' at the First Couple's first inaugural ball. Beyoncé starred opposite Ali Larter and Idris Elba in the thriller, Obsessed. She played Sharon Charles, a mother and wife who learns of a woman's obsessive behavior over her husband. Although the film received negative reviews from critics, the movie did well at the US box office, grossing $68 million—$60 million more than Cadillac Records—on a budget of $20 million.

"On December 13, 2013, Beyoncé unexpectedly released her eponymous fifth studio album on the iTunes Store without any prior announcement or promotion. The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, giving Beyoncé her fifth consecutive number-one album in the US. This made her the first woman in the chart's history to have her first five studio albums debut at number one. Beyoncé received critical acclaim and commercial success, selling one million digital copies worldwide in six days; The New York Times noted the album's unconventional, unexpected release as significant. Musically an electro‐R&B album, it concerns darker themes previously unexplored in her work, such as \'bulimia, postnatal depression [and] the fears and insecurities of marriage and motherhood\'. The single \'Drunk in Love\', featuring Jay Z, peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In April 2014, after much speculation, Beyoncé and Jay Z officially announced their On the Run Tour— their first co‐headlining stadium tour together. On August 24, 2014, she received the Video Vanguard Award at the 2014MTV Video Music Awards, also taking home three competitive awards: Best Video with a Social Message and Best Cinematography for \'Pretty Hurts\', as well as Best Collaboration for \'Drunk in Love\'. In November, Forbes reported that Beyoncé was the top‐earning woman in music for the second year in a row—earning $115 million that year, more than double her 2013earnings.

"With the example of the Ming court's relationship with the fifth Karmapa and other Tibetan leaders, Norbu states that Chinese Communist historians have failed to realize the significance of the religious aspect of the Ming-Tibetan relationship.

Although not recorded in any official Chinese records, Sonam Gyatso's biography states that Wanli again conferred titles on Sonam Gyatso in 1588, and invited him to Beijing for a second time, but Sonam Gyatso was unable to visit China as he died the same year in Mongolia working with Altan Khan's son to further the spread of Buddhism.",10,Why was Sonam Gyatso unable to visit China in 1588?,He declined the invitation,He was prevented by Ming officials,He died in Mongolia working with Altan Khan's son to further the spread of Buddhism,He was exiled to Tibet,3,"Sonam ,Gyatso ድሕሪ ፍጥረት ተዋሂቡ እቲ grandiose ርእሲ ብ Altan ,Khan departed ን .Tibet ቅድሚ ንሱ ,ፀጋም ንሱ ተላኢኹ ሓደ ደብዳበ እና gifts ናብ እቲ Ming Chinese ዘፍለጠ Zhang Juzheng (),1525–1582 አየናይ በፂሑ አብ ልዕሊ መጋቢት ,12 .1579 Sometime አብ ውሽጢ ነሓሰ ወይ መስከረም ካብ እቲ ,ዓመት Sonam 'Gyatso's representative stationed ምስ Altan Khan ዝተቀበለ ሓደ ተመለስ ደብዳበ እና ውህብቶ ካብ እቲ Wanli Emperor (.r ),1572–1620 መን እውን conferred ኣብ ግዘ Sonam Gyatso ሓደ ;ርእሲ እዚ ኔሩ እቲ መጀመርታ ዘፍለጠ መርከቢ አብ መንጎ ሓደ Dalai Lama እና ሓደ መንግስቲ ካብ .China ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ Laird states እቲ መዓዝ Wanli invited ንሱ ናብ ,Beijing እቲ Dalai Lama declined እቲ ውህብቶ መወዳእታ ናብ ሓደ ቅድሚያ ,ግዱስነት ሙሉእ እኳ ንሱ ኔሩ ጥራሕ 400 km (250 )mi ካብ .Beijing Laird adds እቲ 'እቲ ሓይሊ ካብ እቲ Ming emperor ግቡር ዘይኮነ ብፅሕ ብጣዕሚ ርሑቅ ኣብ እቲ .'ግዜ ዋላ እኳ ዘይኮነ recorded አብ ውሽጢ ዝኾነ ዘፍለጠ Chinese ,records Sonam 'Gyatso's biography states እቲ Wanli ካልኣይ conferred titles አብ ልዕሊ Sonam Gyatso አብ ውሽጢ ,1588 እና invited ንሱ ናብ Beijing ን ሓደ ካልኣይ ,ግዜ ግን Sonam Gyatso ኔሩ ኣይከኣልን እዩ ናብ ጎብንይ China ከም ንሱ ሞይቱ እቲ ማዕረ ዓመት አብ ውሽጢ Mongolia ምስራሕ ምስ Altan 'Khan's son ናብ ርሑቅ እቲ ምዝርጋሕ ካብ .Buddhism",ንምንታይ ኔሩ Sonam Gyatso ኣይከኣልን እዩ ናብ ጎብንይ China አብ ውሽጢ ?1588,ንሱ declined እቲ ዕድመ,ንሱ ኔሩ prevented ብ Ming officials,ንሱ ሞይቱ አብ ውሽጢ Mongolia ምስራሕ ምስ Altan 'Khan's son ናብ ርሑቅ እቲ ምዝርጋሕ ካብ Buddhism,ንሱ ኔሩ exiled ናብ Tibet
"In 1565, the powerful Rinbung princes were overthrown by one of their own ministers, Karma Tseten who styled himself as the Tsangpa, 'the one of Tsang', and established his base of power at Shigatse. The second successor of this first Tsang king, Karma Phuntsok Namgyal, took control of the whole of Central Tibet (Ü-Tsang), reigning from 1611–1621. Despite this, the leaders of Lhasa still claimed their allegiance to the Phagmodru as well as the Gelug, while the Ü-Tsang king allied with the Karmapa. Tensions rose between the nationalistic Ü-Tsang ruler and the Mongols who safeguarded their Mongol Dalai Lama in Lhasa. The fourth Dalai Lama refused to give an audience to the Ü-Tsang king, which sparked a conflict as the latter began assaulting Gelug monasteries. Chen writes of the speculation over the fourth Dalai Lama's mysterious death and the plot of the Ü-Tsang king to have him murdered for 'cursing' him with illness, although Chen writes that the murder was most likely the result of a feudal power struggle. In 1618, only two years after Yonten Gyatso died, the Gelug and the Karma Kargyu went to war, the Karma Kargyu supported by the secular Ü-Tsang king. The Ü-Tsang ruler had a large number of Gelugpa lamas killed, occupied their monasteries at Drepung and Sera, and outlawed any attempts to find another Dalai Lama. In 1621, the Ü-Tsang king died and was succeeded by his young son Karma Tenkyong, an event which stymied the war effort as the latter accepted the six-year-old Lozang Gyatso as the new Dalai Lama. Despite the new Dalai Lama's diplomatic efforts to maintain friendly relations with the new Ü-Tsang ruler, Sonam Rapten (1595–1657), the Dalai Lama's chief steward and treasurer at Drepung, made efforts to overthrow the Ü-Tsang king, which led to another conflict. In 1633, the Gelugpas and several thousand Mongol adherents defeated the Ü-Tsang king's troops near Lhasa before a peaceful negotiation was settled.

The second successor of this first Tsang king, Karma Phuntsok Namgyal, took control of the whole of Central Tibet (Ü-Tsang), reigning from 1611–1621. Despite this, the leaders of Lhasa still claimed their allegiance to the Phagmodru as well as the Gelug, while the Ü-Tsang king allied with the Karmapa. Tensions rose between the nationalistic Ü-Tsang ruler and the Mongols who safeguarded their Mongol Dalai Lama in Lhasa. The fourth Dalai Lama refused to give an audience to the Ü-Tsang king, which sparked a conflict as the latter began assaulting Gelug monasteries. Chen writes of the speculation over the fourth Dalai Lama's mysterious death and the plot of the Ü-Tsang king to have him murdered for 'cursing' him with illness, although Chen writes that the murder was most likely the result of a feudal power struggle. In 1618, only two years after Yonten Gyatso died, the Gelug and the Karma Kargyu went to war, the Karma Kargyu supported by the secular Ü-Tsang king. The Ü-Tsang ruler had a large number of Gelugpa lamas killed, occupied their monasteries at Drepung and Sera, and outlawed any attempts to find another Dalai Lama. In 1621, the Ü-Tsang king died and was succeeded by his young son Karma Tenkyong, an event which stymied the war effort as the latter accepted the six-year-old Lozang Gyatso as the new Dalai Lama. Despite the new Dalai Lama's diplomatic efforts to maintain friendly relations with the new Ü-Tsang ruler, Sonam Rapten (1595–1657), the Dalai Lama's chief steward and treasurer at Drepung, made efforts to overthrow the Ü-Tsang king, which led to another conflict. In 1633, the Gelugpas and several thousand Mongol adherents defeated the Ü-Tsang king's troops near Lhasa before a peaceful negotiation was settled.

"In 1565, the powerful Rinbung princes were overthrown by one of their own ministers, Karma Tseten who styled himself as the Tsangpa, 'the one of Tsang', and established his base of power at Shigatse. The second successor of this first Tsang king, Karma Phuntsok Namgyal, took control of the whole of Central Tibet (Ü-Tsang), reigning from 1611–1621. Despite this, the leaders of Lhasa still claimed their allegiance to the Phagmodru as well as the Gelug, while the Ü-Tsang king allied with the Karmapa. Tensions rose between the nationalistic Ü-Tsang ruler and the Mongols who safeguarded their Mongol Dalai Lama in Lhasa. The fourth Dalai Lama refused to give an audience to the Ü-Tsang king, which sparked a conflict as the latter began assaulting Gelug monasteries. Chen writes of the speculation over the fourth Dalai Lama's mysterious death and the plot of the Ü-Tsang king to have him murdered for 'cursing' him with illness, although Chen writes that the murder was most likely the result of a feudal power struggle. In 1618, only two years after Yonten Gyatso died, the Gelug and the Karma Kargyu went to war, the Karma Kargyu supported by the secular Ü-Tsang king. The Ü-Tsang ruler had a large number of Gelugpa lamas killed, occupied their monasteries at Drepung and Sera, and outlawed any attempts to find another Dalai Lama.

"In 1565, the powerful Rinbung princes were overthrown by one of their own ministers, Karma Tseten who styled himself as the Tsangpa, 'the one of Tsang', and established his base of power at Shigatse. The second successor of this first Tsang king, Karma Phuntsok Namgyal, took control of the whole of Central Tibet (Ü-Tsang), reigning from 1611–1621. Despite this, the leaders of Lhasa still claimed their allegiance to the Phagmodru as well as the Gelug, while the Ü-Tsang king allied with the Karmapa. Tensions rose between the nationalistic Ü-Tsang ruler and the Mongols who safeguarded their Mongol Dalai Lama in Lhasa. The fourth Dalai Lama refused to give an audience to the Ü-Tsang king, which sparked a conflict as the latter began assaulting Gelug monasteries. Chen writes of the speculation over the fourth Dalai Lama's mysterious death and the plot of the Ü-Tsang king to have him murdered for 'cursing' him with illness, although Chen writes that the murder was most likely the result of a feudal power struggle. In 1618, only two years after Yonten Gyatso died, the Gelug and the Karma Kargyu went to war, the Karma Kargyu supported by the secular Ü-Tsang king. The Ü-Tsang ruler had a large number of Gelugpa lamas killed, occupied their monasteries at Drepung and Sera, and outlawed any attempts to find another Dalai Lama. In 1621, the Ü-Tsang king died and was succeeded by his young son Karma Tenkyong, an event which stymied the war effort as the latter accepted the six-year-old Lozang Gyatso as the new Dalai Lama.

"iPods with color displays use anti-aliased graphics and text, with sliding animations. All iPods (except the 3rd-generation iPod Shuffle, the 6th & 7th generation iPod Nano, and iPod Touch) have five buttons and the later generations have the buttons integrated into the click wheel – an innovation that gives an uncluttered, minimalist interface. The buttons perform basic functions such as menu, play, pause, next track, and previous track. Other operations, such as scrolling through menu items and controlling the volume, are performed by using the click wheel in a rotational manner. The 3rd-generation iPod Shuffle does not have any controls on the actual player; instead it has a small control on the earphone cable, with volume-up and -down buttons and a single button for play and pause, next track, etc. The iPod Touch has no click-wheel; instead it uses a 3.5' touch screen along with a home button, sleep/wake button and (on the second and third generations of the iPod Touch) volume-up and -down buttons.

"In the 2000s, research in computer science, engineering, psychology and neuroscience has been aimed at developing devices that recognize human affect display and model emotions. In computer science, affective computing is a branch of the study and development of artificial intelligence that deals with the design of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, and process human emotions. It is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer sciences, psychology, and cognitive science. While the origins of the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical enquiries into emotion, the more modern branch of computer science originated with Rosalind Picard's 1995 paper on affective computing. Detecting emotional information begins with passive sensors which capture data about the user's physical state or behavior without interpreting the input. The data gathered is analogous to the cues humans use to perceive emotions in others. Another area within affective computing is the design of computational devices proposed to exhibit either innate emotional capabilities or that are capable of convincingly simulating emotions. Emotional speech processing recognizes the user's emotional state by analyzing speech patterns. The detection and processing of facial expression or body gestures is achieved through detectors and sensors.",2,the answer text should not include any answer choices.,identifying emotional information begins with passive sensors which capture data about the user's physical state or behavior without interpreting the input.

"Over time, the relative power of these five nations fluctuated, which by the dawn of the 20th century had served to create an entirely different balance of power. Some, such as the United Kingdom and Prussia (as the founder of the newly formed German state), experienced continued economic growth and political power. Others, such as Russia and Austria-Hungary, stagnated. At the same time, other states were emerging and expanding in power, largely through the process of industrialization. These countries seeking to attain great power status were: Italy after the Risorgimento, Japan after the Meiji Restoration, and the United States after its civil war. By the dawn of the 20th century, the balance of world power had changed substantially since the Congress of Vienna. The Eight-Nation Alliance was a belligerent alliance of eight nations against the Boxer Rebellion in China.

"Wright himself believed that values >0.25 represent very great genetic variation and that an FST of 0.15–0.25 represented great variation. However, about 5% of human variation occurs between populations within continents, therefore FST values between continental groups of humans (or races) of as low as 0.1 (or possibly lower) have been found in some studies, suggesting more moderate levels of genetic variation. Graves (1996) has countered that FST should not be used as a marker of subspecies status, as the statistic is used to measure the degree of differentiation between populations, although see also Wright (1978).",2,The question should test the reader's understanding of key details from the text.

"Glacial ice is the largest reservoir of freshwater on Earth. Many glaciers from temperate, alpine and seasonal polar climates store water as ice during the colder seasons and release it later in the form of meltwater as warmer summer temperatures cause the glacier to melt, creating a water source that is especially important for plants, animals and human uses when other sources may be scant. Within high altitude and Antarctic environments, the seasonal temperature difference is often not sufficient to release meltwater.",2,Why is there some alternative answer options for the second question on a lake in Antarctica?,The distractor must be contextually relevant but must NOT be the correct answer?,The distractor must be contextually relevant but must NOT be the correct answer.,What is the main reason the glacier to melt?,How do this study occur?,3,በረድ በረድ ኣብ ምድሪ እቲ ዝዓበየ ዕቋር ፍረሽ ማይ እዩ። ብዙሓት ካብ ምዉቕ፣ ኣልፓይንን ወቕታዊ ፖላር ክሊማን ዝመጹ በረድ ኣብ እዋን ዝሑል ወቕቲ ማይ ከም በረድ ይዕቅቡን ድሒሮም ብመልክዕ መቐለጢ ማይ ይለቅቕዎን ምኽንያቱ ውዑይ ናይ ሓጋይ ሙቐት ነቲ በረድ ክፈስስ ይገብሮ፣ እዚ ድማ ብፍላይ ንኣትክልቲ፣ እንስሳታትን ናይ ሰብ ኣጠቓቕማ class ክኸውን ኣብ ዝኽእለሉ እዋን ንኣጠቓቕማ ሰብን ኣገዳሲ ዝኾነ ምንጪ ማይ ይፈጥር። ኣብ ውሽጢ ልዑል ቁመትን ኣንታርክቲክ ከባቢታትን፡ እቲ ናይ ወቕታዊ ሙቐት ፍልልይ መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ንፍሰት ማይ ንምፍናው እኹል ኣይኮነን።,ኣብ ኣንታርክቲካ ኣብ ዝርከብ ቀላይ ንኻልኣይ ሕቶ ዝኸውን ገለ ኣማራጺ መልሲ ኣማራጺታት ንምንታይ ኣሎ?,እቲ ምዝንጋዕ ኣብ ትሕቲ ጽሑፍ ኣገዳሲ ክኸውን ኣለዎ ግን ቅኑዕ መልሲ ክኸውን የብሉን?,እቲ ምዝንጋዕ ኣብ ጽሑፍ ኣገዳሲ ክኸውን ኣለዎ ግን ቅኑዕ መልሲ ክኸውን የብሉን።,እቲ በረድ ንኽፈስስ ቀንዲ ምኽንያት እንታይ እዩ?,እዚ መጽናዕቲ እዚ ብኸመይ እዩ ዚፍጸም፧
"In practice, not all rule violations will result in a disqualification as the referee may use their own judgement and is not obligated to stop the match. Usually, the only offenses that the referee will see and immediately disqualify the match on (as opposed to having multiple offenses) are low blows, weapon usage, interference, or assaulting the referee. In WWE, a referee must see the violation with their own eyes to rule that the match end in a disqualification (simply watching the video tape is not usually enough) and the referee's ruling is almost always final, although Dusty finishes (named after, and made famous by, Dusty Rhodes) will often result in the referee's decision being overturned. It is not uncommon for the referees themselves to get knocked out during a match, which is commonly referred to by the term 'ref bump'. While the referee remains 'unconscious', wrestlers are free to violate rules until the referee is revived or replaced. In some cases, a referee might disqualify a person under the presumption that it was that wrestler who knocked them out; most referee knockouts are arranged to allow a wrestler, usually a heel, to gain an advantage. For example, a wrestler may get whipped into a referee at a slower speed, knocking the ref down for short amount of time; during that interim period, one wrestler may pin their opponent for a three-count and would have won the match but for the referee being down (sometimes, another referee will sprint to the ring from backstage to attempt to make the count, but by then, the other wrestler has had enough time to kick-out on their own accord).",2,What is a high-quality multiple-choice question provided by a reporter?,What should be contextually relevant but MUST NOT be the correct answer?,What does the distractor must be contextually relevant?,What are the only offenses the referee will see and immediately disqualify the match?,The distractor must be contextually relevant but must NOT be the correct answer?,3,"ብተግባር፡ ዳኛ ናይ ገዛእ ርእሶም ፍርዲ ክጥቀም ስለ ዝኽእልን ነቲ ጸወታ ደው ከብሎ ግዴታ ስለዘይብሉን፡ ኩሉ ምጥሓስ ሕጊ ምውጋድ ዘስዕብ ኣይኮነን። መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ፡ እቲ ዳኛ ነቲ ጸወታ ዝሪኦን ብቕጽበት ዘገድሶን እንኮ ገበናት (ኣንጻር ብዙሕ ገበናት ምህላው) ትሑት ጽፍዒት፡ ኣጠቓቕማ ኣጽዋር፡ ምትእትታው፡ ወይ ንዳኛ ምጥቃዕ ጥራይ እዩ። ኣብ WWE፡ ሓደ ዳኛ ነቲ ግህሰት ብዓይኑ ክሪኦ ኣለዎ፡ እቲ ግጥም ኣብ ምውጋድ (ብቐሊሉ ነቲ ናይ ቪድዮ ቴፕ ምርኣይ መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ እኹል ኣይኮነን) ክውድእ ኣለዎ፡ እቲ ዳኛ ድማ ዳርጋ ኩሉ ግዜ ናይ መወዳእታ እዩ፡ ዋላ’ኳ ሓመድ ዝመልኦ ወዲኡ (ስሙ ብስሙ፡ ከምኡ’ውን ብህቡብ ብግልጺ ዝተሰርሐ)፡ መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ውሳነ ዳኛ ክግልበጥ ይገብር። ኣብ እዋን ግጥም ባዕሎም ደያኑ ንባዕሎም ክወዳደሩ ልሙድ ኣይኮነን፣ እዚ ድማ ልሙድ ብ'Ref Bump' ዝብል ቃል ዝጽዋዕ እዩ። ዳኛ 'ዘይህላው' ኮይኑ ክቕጽል እንከሎ፡ ተቓለልቲ ግን ዳኛ ክሳብ ዝትንስእ ወይ ዝትካእ ሕግታት ክጥሕሱ ነጻ እዮም። ኣብ ገለ ገለ ኣጋጣሚታት ሓደ ዳኛ ንሓደ ሰብ ካብ ስልጣኑ ከውጽኦ ይኽእል እዩ ብዝብል ግምታት ንሱ እዩ እቲ ተቓላሳይ ኣውዲቑዎም፤ መብዛሕትኦም ናይ ዳኛ ኖክኣውት ንሓደ ተቐዳዳማይ፡ መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ሸኾናኡ፡ ብልጫ ንምርካብ ንኽፍቀድ ተሰሪዑ ኣሎ። ንኣብነት ሓደ ተቐዳዳማይ ብዝሓሰረ ፍጥነት ናብ ዳኛ ክግረፍ ይኽእል እዩ፣ ነቲ መወከሲ ድማ ንሓጺር ግዜ ከውድቖ፤ ኣብቲ ግዝያዊ ግዜ ሓደ ተቐዳዳማይ ንሰለስተ ቆጸራ ንመጋጥምቶም ክስንጥቖም ይኽእል እዩ እሞ ነቲ ጸወታ ምተዓወተሉ ነይሩ ግን ንደያኑ ንታሕቲ ምዃኑ (ሓድሓደ ግዜ፡ ካልእ ዳኛ ካብ ድሕሪ መድረኽ ናብ ቀለቤት ብምኻድ ነቲ ቆጸራ ንምግባር ክፍትን እዩ፡ ኣብቲ እዋን እቲ ግን እቲ ካልእ ተቐዳዳማይ ብገዛእ ርእሱ ንኽወጽእ እኹል ግዜ ነይርዎ)።",ሓደ ሪፖርተር ዝቐረበ ልዑል ጽሬት ዘለዎ ብዙሕ ምርጫ ዘለዎ ሕቶ እንታይ እዩ?,እንታይ ክኸውን ኣለዎ ግን ቅኑዕ መልሲ ክኸውን የብሉን?,እቲ ምዝንጋዕ ኣብ ትሕቲ ጽሑፍ እንታይ ኣገዳሲ ክኸውን ኣለዎ?,ዳኛ እንታይ ጥራይ እዮም ዳኛ ዝሪኦን ብቕጽበት ንጸወታ ዘገድሶን?,እቲ ምዝንጋዕ ኣብ ትሕቲ ጽሑፍ ኣገዳሲ ክኸውን ኣለዎ ግን ቅኑዕ መልሲ ክኸውን የብሉን?

"During the Reformation, the term was hardly used outside of the German politics. The word evangelical (German: evangelisch), which refers to the gospel, was much more widely used for those involved in the religious movement. Nowadays, this word is still preferred among some of the historical Protestant denominations, above all the ones in the German-speaking area such as the EKD. The German word evangelisch means Protestant, and is different from the German evangelikal, which refers to churches shaped by Evangelicalism. The English word evangelical usually refers to Evangelical Protestant churches, and therefore not to Protestantism as a whole. It traces its roots back to the Puritans in England, where Evangelicalism originated, and then was brought to the United States. The word reformatorisch is used as an alternative for evangelisch in German, and is different from English reformed (German: reformiert), which refers to churches shaped by ideas of John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli and other Reformed theologians.",1,The three verses of the German word reformatorisch should test the reader's understanding of key details from the text?,"In English, what word is evangelisch considered an alternative?",Why is it better to think about the Bible as a way of saying that it was a Christian?,Evangelical Protestant churches are different from English reformed?,"In order to translate the text, how could we use the word reformatorisch?",3,ኣብ እዋን ተሃድሶ፡ እቲ ቃል ካብ ፖለቲካ ጀርመን ወጻኢ ዳርጋ ኣይጥቀመሉን ነይሩ። ወንጌላውያን (ጀርመን: ወንጌልሊሽ) ዝብል ቃል ንወንጌል ዘመልክት ኮይኑ፡ ነቶም ኣብቲ ሃይማኖታዊ ምንቅስቓስ ንዝነጥፉ ሰባት ኣዝዩ ዝሰፍሐ እዩ ነይሩ። ኣብዚ ግዜ እዚ፡ እዚ ቃል እዚ፡ ኣብ ገለ ካብቶም ታሪኻዊ ፕሮቴስታንት ዲኖሚንየን፡ ልዕሊ ዅሎም ኣብቲ ከም EKD ዝኣመሰለ ጀርመናዊ ተዛረብቲ ዝኣመሰለ ቦታ፡ ልዕሊ ዅሉ ኻብቶም ዛጊት ዝምረጽ እዩ። እቲ ጀርመናዊ ቃል ወንጌላውያን ማለት ፕሮቴስታንት ማለት እዩ፣ ካብቲ ብወንጌላውነት ዝተቐርጸ ኣብያተ ክርስቲያናት ዘመልክት ጀርመናዊ ወንጌል ዝተፈልየ እዩ። እቲ ናይ እንግሊዝኛ ቃል ወንጌላውያን መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ንወንጌላውያን ፕሮቴስታንት ኣብያተ ክርስትያናት የመልክት፣ ስለዚ ድማ ንፕሮቴስታንት ብሓፈሻ ኣይኮነን። ሱሩ ካብቲ ወንጌላውነት ዝጀመረሉ ኣብ ዓዲ እንግሊዝ ዝነበረ ፒዩሪታናት ይመልስ፣ ድሕሪኡ ናብ ኣሜሪካ ኣምጺኡ። እቲ ሪፎርሜቶሪሽ ዝብል ቃል ብቋንቋ ጀርመናዊ ከም ኣማራጺ ንኢንጌንጀሊሽ ዝጥቀመሉ ኮይኑ፡ ካብቲ ብሓሳባት ጆን ካልቪን፡ ሁልድሪች ዚዊንግሊን ካልኦት ተሃድሶ ዘለዎም ቲዮሎማውያንን ዝተቐርጹ ኣብያተ ክርስቲያናት ዘመልክት ናይ እንግሊዝ ተሃድሶ (German: Reforierert) ዝተፈልየ እዩ።,እተን ሰለስተ ጥቕስታት ናይ ጀርመናዊ ቃል Reforatorisch ንኣንባቢ ብዛዕባ ቁልፊ ዝርዝራት ካብቲ ጽሑፍ ዘለዎ ርድኢት ክፍትን ይግባእ ድዩ?,ብእንግሊዝኛ፡ ኢቫንጀሊሽ ከም ኣማራጺ እንታይ ቃል እዩ ዝቑጸር?,ስለምንታይ እዩ ብዛዕባ መጽሓፍ ቅዱስ ክርስትያን እዩ ኢልካ ምሕሳብ ይሓይሽ?,ወንጌላውያን ፕሮቴስታንት ኣብያተ ክርስትያናት ካብ እንግሊዝኛ ዝተፈለየ ዝተፈልየ እዩ?,ነቲ ጽሑፍ ንምትርጓም፡ ከመይ ጌርና ኢና ነቲ Reforatorisch ዝብል ቃል ክንጥቀመሉ ንኽእል?

"In 1948, Eisenhower became President of Columbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City. The assignment was described as not being a good fit in either direction. During that year Eisenhower's memoir, Crusade in Europe, was published. Critics regarded it as one of the finest U.S. military memoirs, and it was a major financial success as well. Eisenhower's profit on the book was substantially aided by an unprecedented ruling by the U.S. Department of the Treasury that Eisenhower was not a professional writer, but rather, marketing the lifetime asset of his experiences, and thus he only had to pay capital gains tax on his $635,000 advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate.

Analysis of MPI results by Turk and Rudy (1988) found three classes of chronic pain patient: '(a) dysfunctional, people who perceived the severity of their pain to be high, reported that pain interfered with much of their lives, reported a higher degree of psychological distress caused by pain, and reported low levels of activity; (b) interpersonally distressed, people with a common perception that significant others were not very supportive of their pain problems; and (c) adaptive copers, patients who reported high levels of social support, relatively low levels of pain and perceived interference, and relatively high levels of activity.'

"After graduating from high school, West received a scholarship to attend Chicago's American Academy of Art in 1997 and began taking painting classes, but shortly after transferred to Chicago State University to study English. He soon realized that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his musical work, and at 20 he dropped out of college to pursue his musical dreams.

"Insect respiration is accomplished without lungs. Instead, the insect respiratory system uses a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries, and instead consists of little more than a single, perforated dorsal tube which pulses peristaltically. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart. The opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of the insect circulating the hemolymph, arthropods' fluid analog of blood, inside the body cavity.:61–65 Air is taken in through openings on the sides of the abdomen called spiracles.",2,What should be used to create an high quality multiple-choice question?,- Where does the distractor are contextually relevant but must NOT be the correct answer?,The insect respiratory system uses a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped,The distractor must be contextually relevant but must NOT be the correct answer,The distractor must be contextually relevant but must NOT be the correct answer?,2,ምትንፋስ ጣንጡ ብዘይ ሳንቡእ ይፍጸም። ኣብ ክንድኡ፡ እቲ ስርዓተ ምስትንፋስ ጣንጡ፡ ጋዛት ወይ ዝዝርግሑ ወይ ብንጥፈት ዝንቀሳቐሱሉ ስርዓት ውሽጣዊ ቱቦታትን ሳክስን ይጥቀም፡ እዚ ድማ ብቐጥታ ናብቲ ብመንገዲ ትራክያኦም ዘድልዮ ቲሹታት ኦክስጅን የብጽሕ (Element 8 in numbered diagram)። ኦክስጅን ብቐጥታ ስለ ዝቐርብ፡ እቲ ስርዓተ ዑደት ደም ኦክስጅን ንምስካም ኣይጥቀመሉን እዩ፡ ስለዚ ድማ ኣዝዩ ይንኪ። እቲ ስርዓተ ዑደት ደም ጣንጡ ሰራውር ወይ ሻምብቆታት ደም የብሉን፣ ኣብ ክንድኡ ድማ ካብ ሓደ፣ ነዃል ዘለዎ ዶርሳል ቱቦ ዝዛይድ ውሑድ ዝቖመ ኮይኑ peristaltaltically ይንብድድ። ናብቲ ቶራክስ ገጹ፡ እቲ ድሕሪት ቱቦ (ባእታ 14) ኣብ ክፍልታት ይመቓቐል እሞ ከም ልቢ ናይቲ ጣንጡ ይዋሳእ። እቲ ኣንጻር ጫፍ ናይቲ ድሕሪት ቱቦ ከም ኣኦርታ ናይቲ ጣንጡ ዝዘውር ጣንጡ ዝዘውር ሄሞሊምፍ፣ ናይ ኣርትሮፖድስ ፈሳሲ ኣናሎግ ደም፣ ኣብ ውሽጢ ጕድጓድ ኣካላት።:61–65 ኣየር ብመኽፈቲታት ኣብ ጐድኒ ከብዲ ስፒራክልስ ይውሰድ።,ልዑል ፅሬት ዘለዎ ብዙሕ ምርጫ ዘለዎ ሕቶ ንምፍጣር እንታይ ክውዕል ኣለዎ?,- እቲ ትኩረት ዝሰርቕ ኣበይ እዩ ኣብ ትሕቲ ጽውጽዋይ ዝዛመድ ኮይኑ ግን ቅኑዕ መልሲ ክኸውን የብሉን?,እቲ ጣንጡ ስርዓተ ምስትንፋስ ስርዓት፡ ጋዛት ወይ ዝዝርግሑ ወይ ብንጥፈት ዝንቀሳቐሱሉ ስርዓት ውሽጣዊ ቱቦታትን ሳክስን ይጥቀም .,እቲ ምዝንባል ኣብ ትሕቲ ጽሑፍ ኣገዳሲ ክኸውን ኣለዎ ግን ቅኑዕ መልሲ ክኸውን የብሉን ።,እቲ ምዝንጋዕ ኣብ ትሕቲ ጽሑፍ ኣገዳሲ ክኸውን ኣለዎ ግን ቅኑዕ መልሲ ክኸውን የብሉን?

"Excessive devotion and enthusiasm in religious observance were superstitio, in the sense of 'doing or believing more than was necessary', to which women and foreigners were considered particularly prone. The boundaries between religio and superstitio are perhaps indefinite. The famous tirade of Lucretius, the Epicurean rationalist, against what is usually translated as 'superstition' was in fact aimed at excessive religio. Roman religion was based on knowledge rather than faith, but superstitio was viewed as an 'inappropriate desire for knowledge'; in effect, an abuse of religio.",2,What type of question is sufficient to test the reader's understanding of key details from the text?,What type of question is sufficient for the reader to understand the key details?,What is an example of a superstitio?,insufficient?,What type of question is sufficient?,2,"ኣብ ሃይማኖታዊ ምኽባር ካብ መጠን ንላዕሊ ውፉይነትን ኒሕን ኣጉልስቲዮ እዩ ነይሩ፣ ብመንጽር 'ካብቲ ዘድሊ ንላዕሊ ምግባር ወይ ምእማን' ዝብል ትርጉሙ፡ ደቂ ኣንስትዮን ወጻእተኛታትን ብፍላይ ከም ዝቐንዑ ዝቑጸሩ እዮም። ኣብ መንጎ ሃይማኖትን ኣጉልስቲቲዮን ዘሎ ዶባት ምናልባት ዘይተወሰነ ክኸውን ይኽእል እዩ። እቲ ፍሉጥ ናይ ሉክረቲየስ፡ እቲ ኤፒኩርያዊ ርትዓዊ ዝኾነ፡ ኣንጻር እቲ መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ 'ልዕለ-መጽናዕቲ' ተባሂሉ ዝትርጎም፡ ብሓቂ ናብ ልዕሊ ዓቐን ሃይማኖት ዝዓለመ እዩ ነይሩ። ሃይማኖት ሮማ ኣብ እምነት ዘይኮነስ ኣብ ፍልጠት ዝተመርኮሰ እዩ ነይሩ፣ ኣጉልስቲቲዮ ግን ከም 'ዘይግቡእ ድሌት ፍልጠት' እዩ ተራእዩ፤ ከም ሓቂ ኣብ ልዕሊ ሃይማኖታዊ ግህሰት።",ንኣንባቢ ካብቲ ጽሑፍ ኣብ ቁልፊ ዝርዝራት ዘለዎ ርድኢት ንምፍታን እንታይ ዓይነት ሕቶ እኹል እዩ?,ኣንባቢ ነቲ ቁልፊ ዝርዝራት ንምርዳእ እንታይ ዓይነት ሕቶ እኹል እዩ?,ኣብነት ናይ ሓደ Superstitio እንታይ እዩ?,እኹል ዘይኮነ?,እንታይ ዓይነት ሕቶ እኹል እዩ?

"The Compact Disc is an evolution of LaserDisc technology, where a focused laser beam is used that enables the high information density required for high-quality digital audio signals. Prototypes were developed by Philips and Sony independently in the late 1970s. In 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc. After a year of experimentation and discussion, the Red Book CD-DA standard was published in 1980. After their commercial release in 1982, compact discs and their players were extremely popular. Despite costing up to $1,000, over 400,000 CD players were sold in the United States between 1983 and 1984. The success of the compact disc has been credited to the cooperation between Philips and Sony, who came together to agree upon and develop compatible hardware. The unified design of the compact disc allowed consumers to purchase any disc or player from any company, and allowed the CD to dominate the at-home music market unchallenged.",2,The passage gives readers a high-quality multiple-choice question based on the following passage.,How can a credible but incorrect answer for the following question based on the passage?,What do the Passage gives readers the incorrect answer for the following question based on the passage?,What is the factual answer to the Compact Disc?,"if the corresponding difficult answer must be contextually relevant, but must NOT be the correct answer, click on the appropriate button to answer a plausible but incorrect answer for the following question based on the passage.",3,"እቲ ኮምፓክት ዲስክ ፍልቀት ናይ ሌዘርዲስክ ቴክኖሎጂ ኮይኑ፡ ንልዑል ጽሬት ዘለዎ ዲጂታላዊ ምልክታት ድምጺ ዘድሊ ልዑል ጽቕጥቕጥ ሓበሬታ ዘኽእል ትኹረት ዝገበረ ሌዘር ጩራ ይጥቀም። ፕሮቶታይፕስ ብፊሊፕስን ሶኒን ኣብ መወዳእታ ሰብዓታት ብናጻ ዝተማዕበሉ እዮም። ኣብ 1979 ሶኒን ፊሊፕስን ሓድሽ ዲጂታል ኦድዮ ዲስክ ንምንዳፍ ናይ ሓባር ሓይሊ ዕማም መሃንድሳት ኣዳለወ። ድሕሪ ናይ ሓደ ዓመት ናይ ፈተነን ዘተን፡ ቀይሕ መጽሓፍ CD-DA ስታንዳርድ ኣብ 1980 ተሓቲሙ።ድሕሪ ንግዳዊ ምዝርጋሕ ኣብ 1982፡ ኮምፓክት ዲስክታትን ተጻወትቶምን ኣዝዮም ተፈተውቲ ነይሮም። ክሳብ 1000 ዶላር ዝበጽሕ እኳ እንተኾነ፡ ኣብ መንጎ 1983ን 1984ን ኣብ ኣመሪካ ልዕሊ 400,000 ተጻወትቲ ሲዲ ተሸይጡ።ዓወት ናይቲ ኮምፓክት ዲስክ፡ ነቲ ኣብ መንጎ ፊሊፕስን ሶኒን ዝነበረ ምትሕግጋዝ ተሰማሚዑ፡ ንምስምማዕን ኣብ ልዕሊ ዝሰማማዕ ሃርድዌር ንምምዕባልን ዝተኣኻኸበ ምትሕብባር ተገይሩሉ ኣሎ። እቲ ውሁድ ዲዛይን ናይቲ ኮምፓክት ዲስክ፡ ተጠቀምቲ ካብ ዝኾነ ኩባንያ ዝኾነ ዲስክ ወይ ተጻዋታይ ክገዝኡ ኣኽኢልዎም፡ እቲ ሲዲ ድማ ነቲ ኣብ ገዛ ዘሎ ዕዳጋ ሙዚቃ ከይተበታተነ ክዕብለል ኣኽኢልዎ።",እቲ ክፍሊ ንኣንበብቲ ኣብዚ ዝስዕብ ክፍሊ ተመርኲሱ ልዑል ጽሬት ዘለዎ ብዙሕ ምርጫ ዘለዎ ሕቶ ይህቦም።,ከመይ ኢሉ ተኣማንነት ግን ከኣ ዘይቅኑዕ መልሲ ነዚ ዝስዕብ ሕቶ ኣብቲ ክፍሊ ተመርኲሱ?,እቲ ክፍሊ ንኣንበብቲ ኣብቲ ክፍሊ ተመርኲሱ ነዚ ዝስዕብ ሕቶ ዘይቅኑዕ መልሲ ዝህቦም እንታይ እዩ?,እቲ ጭቡጥ መልሲ ናይቲ ኮምፓክት ዲስክ እንታይ እዩ?,እቲ ተዛማዲ ከቢድ መልሲ ኣብ ትሕቲ ጽሑፍ ኣገዳሲ ክኸውን ኣለዎ፡ ግን ከኣ ቅኑዕ መልሲ ክኸውን እንተዘይብሉ፡ ነቲ ዝምልከቶ መጠወቒ ጠውቕ፡ ነቲ ኣብቲ ክፍሊ ተመርኲሱ፡ ነዚ ዝስዕብ ሕቶ ዝኸውን ጌጋ ግን ከኣ ዘይቅኑዕ መልሲ ንምምላስ።
"With the continuing controversy that had surrounded the military service of George W. Bush since the 2000 Presidential election (when he was accused of having used his father's political influence to gain entrance to the Texas Air National Guard, thereby protecting himself from conscription into the United States Army, and possible service in the Vietnam War), John Kerry's contrasting status as a decorated Vietnam War veteran posed a problem for Bush's re-election campaign, which Republicans sought to counter by calling Kerry's war record into question. As the presidential campaign of 2004 developed, approximately 250 members of a group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT, later renamed Swift Vets and POWs for Truth) opposed Kerry's campaign. The group held press conferences, ran ads and endorsed a book questioning Kerry's service record and his military awards. The group included several members of Kerry's unit, such as Larry Thurlow, who commanded a swift boat alongside of Kerry's, and Stephen Gardner, who served on Kerry's boat. The campaign inspired the widely used political pejorative 'swiftboating', to describe an unfair or untrue political attack. Most of Kerry's former crewmates have stated that SBVT's allegations are false.",1,What did the democrats want to do with Kerry?,What did the democrats think Kerry's war record was wrong?,What must be contextually relevant but must NOT be the correct answer?,"if it was not the correct answer to Kerry's war record, the organization ruled on the false flag in 2004?",incorrect answer for the following question based on the passage,1,ምስቲ ካብ 2000 ፕረዚደንታዊ ምርጫ ጀሚሩ ንወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት ጆርጅ ቡሽ ንወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት ዝኸበበ ቀጻሊ ክትዕ (ናይ ኣቡኡ ፖለቲካዊ ጽልዋ ተጠቒሙ ናብ ሃገራዊ ሓለዋ ኣየር ቴክሳስ መእተዊ ረኺቡ ተባሂሉ ምስ ተኸሰሰ፡ በዚ ድማ ናብ ሰራዊት ሕቡራት መንግስታት ኣመሪካ ካብ ምውሳእ ንርእሱ ይከላኸለላ ነበረ፣ ኣብ ኲናት ቬትናም ካብ ዝመጽእ ኣገልግሎት ክህሉ ዝኽእል ኣገልግሎት፡ ከምኡ’ውን ኣብ ልዕሊ እቲ ኣብ ልዕሊ እቲ ዝተሰለመ ናይ ቬትናም ኲናት ገዲም ተጋደልቲ ገዲምዎት ዝነበረ ናይ ዲያሚክ ናይ ቬትናም ገዲም ተጋራጫዊ ኩነታት፡ ነቲ ኣብ ልዕሊ እቲ ዝጽዋዕ ዝነበረ ናይ ዲያፕሊክ ገዲም ተጋራጫዊ ኩነታት፡ ንርእሱ ክኸፍል ዝኽእል ኣገልግሎት ክኸፍሎ ይኽእል እዩ ነይሩ፡ እዚ ድማ ነቲ ናይ ምቁጣብ ምቁዋሮ ስእላ ክብረወሰን ኲናት ኬሪ ኣብ ሕቶ ምልክት ምእታው። ናይ 2004 ፕረዚደንታዊ ጎስጓስ እናማዕበለ ምስ ከደ፡ ኣስታት 250 ኣባላት ናይ ሓደ ስዊፍት ቦት ገዳይም ተጋደልቲ ንሓቂ (SBVT፡ ድሒሩ Swift Vets and Pows for Truth ዝብል ስም ዝወሰደ) ንወፍሪ ኬሪ ተቓዊሞሞ። እቲ ጉጅለ ጋዜጣዊ ዋዕላታት ኣካይዱ፡ መወዓውዒታት ኣካይዱ፡ ንመዝገብ ኣገልግሎት ኬሪን ወተሃደራዊ ሽልማታቱን ኣብ ሕቶ ዘእቱ መጽሓፍ ኣጽዲቑ። እቲ ጉጅለ፡ ሓያሎ ኣባላት ኣሃዱታት ኬሪ፡ ከም በዓል ላሪ ቱርሎው ዝኣመሰሉ፡ ኣብ ጎኒ ናይ ኬሪስ ቅልጡፍ ጃልባ ዝእዝዝ ዝነበረን፡ ኣብ ጃልባ ኬሪ ዘገልገለ ስቲቨን ጋርድነርን ዝሓቖፈ ነበረ። እቲ ወፍሪ ነቲ ብሰፊሑ ዝጥቀመሉ ፖለቲካዊ ፐዮሪቲቭ ‘ስዊፍትቦቲንግ’ ኣነቓቒሑ፣ ንዘይፍትሓዊ ወይ ዘይሓቀኛ ፖለቲካዊ መጥቃዕቲ ንምግላጽ። መብዛሕትኦም መሓዙት ሰራሕተኛታት ኬሪ ነበር፡ ክስታት SBVT ሓሶት ምዃኑ ገሊጾም።,ዲሞክራስያውያን ምስ ኬሪ እንታይ ክገብሩ ደልዮም?,ዲሞክራስያውያን መዝገብ ኲናት ኬሪ ጌጋ እዩ ዝመስሎም ነይሩ?,እንታይ እዩ ብዓውደ-ጽሑፍ ኣገዳሲ ክኸውን ኣለዎ ግን ቅኑዕ መልሲ ክኸውን የብሉን?,ንመዝገብ ኲናት ኬሪ ቅኑዕ መልሲ እንተዘይኮይኑ፡ እቲ ትካል ኣብ 2004 ኣብ ልዕሊ እቲ ናይ ሓሶት ባንዴራ ወሲኑ?,ኣብቲ ክፍሊ ተመርኲሱ ንዝስዕብ ሕቶ ዝኸውን ዘይቅኑዕ መልሲ

"During the later Roman Empire, the principal military developments were attempts to create an effective cavalry force as well as the continued development of highly specialised types of troops. The creation of heavily armoured cataphract-type soldiers as cavalry was an important feature of the 5th-century Roman military. The various invading tribes had differing emphasis on types of soldiers—ranging from the primarily infantry Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain to the Vandals and Visigoths, who had a high proportion of cavalry in their armies. During the early invasion period, the stirrup had not been introduced into warfare, which limited the usefulness of cavalry as shock troops because it was not possible to put the full force of the horse and rider behind blows struck by the rider. The greatest change in military affairs during the invasion period was the adoption of the Hunnic composite bow in place of the earlier, and weaker, Scythian composite bow. Another development was the increasing use of longswords and the progressive replacement of scale armour by mail armour and lamellar armour.",1,What was the most notable way to build a high-quality multiple-choice question?,The distractor must be contextually relevant but must NOT be the correct answer.,"the Hunnic composite bow in place of the earlier, and weaker, Scythian composite bow.",plausible but incorrect answer for the following question based on the passage.,The distractor must be contextually relevant but must NOT be the correct answer,2,ኣብቲ ድሒሩ ዝመጸ ግዝኣት ሮማ፡ እቲ ቀንዲ ወተሃደራዊ ምዕባለታት ውጽኢታዊ ሓይሊ ፈረሰኛታት ንምፍጣር ዝተገብረ ፈተነታት ከምኡ’ውን ቀጻሊ ምዕባለ ኣዝዮም ፍሉያት ዓይነታት ሰራዊት ንምፍጣር ዝተገብረ ፈተነታት እዩ ነይሩ። ፈረሰኛታት ከም ፈረሰኛታት መጠን ብኸቢድ ዕጥቃዊ ዕጥቃዊ ዕጥቃዊ ዝኾነ ዓይነት ወተሃደራት ምፍጣር ኣገዳሲ መለለዪ ናይቲ ኣብ መበል 5ይ ክፍለ ዘመን ዝነበረ ወተሃደራዊ ወተሃደራት ሮማ እዩ ነይሩ። እቶም ዝተፈላለዩ ወረርቲ ቀቢላታት ኣብ ዓይነታት ወተሃደራት ዝተፈላለየ ኣተኩሮ ነበሮም- ካብቶም ብቐንዱ ኣጋር ኣጋርት ኣንግሎ-ሳክሶን ወረርቲ ብሪጣንያ ክሳብ እቶም ኣብ ሰራዊቶም ልዑል ብዝሒ ፈረሰኛታት ዝነበሮም ዕንወትን ቪሲጎትን ዝበጽሑ። ኣብቲ ናይ መጀመርታ ወራር ግዜ፡ እቲ ስቲሩፕ ኣብ ውግእ ኣይተኣታተወን ነይሩ፡ እዚ ድማ ንጥቕሚ ፈረሰኛታት ከም ስንባደ ሰራዊት ከም ሰንበድበድቲ ወተሃደራት ዝድርት ዝነበረ፡ ምሉእ ሓይሊ ናይቲ ፈረስን ተቐዳዳማይን ብድሕሪ እቲ ተቐዳዳማይ ዝሃረሞ ንፋስ ምቕማጥ ስለዘይከኣል እዩ። ኣብ እዋን ወራር እቲ ዝዓበየ ለውጢ ኣብ ወተሃደራዊ ጉዳያት፡ ኣብ ክንዲ እቲ ኣቐዲሙ ዝነበረ፡ ከምኡ’ውን ዝደኸመ፡ ስኪቲያን ኮምፖዚት ቦው፡ ሁኒክ ኮምፖዚት ቦው ምቕባል እዩ። ካልእ ምዕባለ ድማ ሎንግ ስዎርድስ ምጥቃምን ብፖስታ ዕጥቂን ላሜላር ኣርሞርን ስኬል ኣርሞር ገስጋሲ ምትካእን እዩ ነይሩ።,ልዑል ጽሬት ዘለዎ ብዙሕ ምርጫታት ዘለዎ ሕቶ ንምህናጽ እቲ ዝዓበየ መንገዲ እንታይ እዩ ነይሩ?,እቲ ምዝንጋዕ ኣብ ጽሑፍ ኣገዳሲ ክኸውን ኣለዎ ግን ቅኑዕ መልሲ ክኸውን የብሉን።,እቲ ሁኒክ ኮምፖዚት ቀስቲ ኣብ ክንዲ እቲ ኣቐዲሙ ዝነበረ፡ ከምኡ’ውን ዝደኸመ፡ ስኪቲያዊ ውሁድ ቀስቲ።,ኣብቲ ክፍሊ ተመርኲሱ ነዚ ዝስዕብ ሕቶ ዘእምን ግን ከኣ ዘይቅኑዕ መልሲ።,እቲ ምዝንባል ኣብ ትሕቲ ጽሑፍ ኣገዳሲ ክኸውን ኣለዎ ግን ቅኑዕ መልሲ ክኸውን የብሉን ።
"In the early 19th century, the Indigenous American woman Sacagawea, who would help translate for and guide the Lewis and Clark Expedition in the West, married the French trapper Toussaint Charbonneau. Most marriages between Europeans and Indigenous Americans were between European men and Indigenous American women. Depending on the kinship system of the woman's tribe, their children would be more or less easily assimilated into the tribe. Nations that had matrilineal systems, such as the Creek and Cherokee in the Southeast, gave the mixed-race children status in their mother's clans and tribes. If the tribe had a patrilineal system, like the Omaha, the children of white fathers were considered white. Unless they were specifically adopted into the tribe by an adult male, they could have no social status in it.",1,How did the author understand key details?,How did the indigenous American woman translate for and guide the Lewis and Clark Expedition in the West?,"Depending on the kinship system of the woman's tribe, their children would be more or less easily assimilated into the tribe","Depending on the kinship system of the woman's tribe, their children would be more or less easily assimilated into the tribe.",True but incorrect answer for the following question based on the passage,1,ኣብ መጀመርታ መበል 19 ክፍለ ዘመን፡ እታ ኣብ ምዕራብ ንወፍሪ ሉዊስን ክላርክን ንምትርጓምን ክትመርሕን እትሕግዝ ደቀባት ኣመሪካዊት ሳካጋዌኣ፡ ንፈረንሳዊት ትራፐር ቱስሳንት ቻርቦኖ ተመርዕያ። መብዛሕትኡ ኣብ መንጎ ኤውሮጳውያንን ደቀባት ኣመሪካውያንን ዝግበር ሓዳር ኣብ መንጎ ደቂ ተባዕትዮ ኤውሮጳን ደቀባት ኣመሪካን እዩ ነይሩ። ከከም ስርዓተ ዘመድ ቀቢላ እታ ሰበይቲ፡ ደቆም ናብቲ ቀቢላ ብውሑድ ብብዙሕ ብቐሊሉ ይውሃሃዱ ነበሩ። ኣብ ደቡባዊ ምብራቕ ከም በዓል ክሪክን ቸሮኪን ዝኣመሰላ ናይ ማትሪሊነላዊ ስርዓታት ዝነበራ ኣህዛብ፡ ነቶም ዝተሓዋወሱ ዓሌት ዝኾኑ ህጻናት ኣብ ዓሌታትን ቀቢላታትን ኣዲኦም ደረጃ ሂቦምዋ። እቲ ቀቢላ ከም ኦማሃ ፓትሪሊናዊ ስርዓት እንተዝህልዎ፡ ደቂ ጸለምቲ ኣቦታት ከም ጸለምቲ ይቑጸሩ ነበሩ። ብፍሉይ ብዓበይቲ ተባዕታይ ናብቲ ቀቢላ እንተዘይተቐሚጦም፡ ኣብኡ ማሕበራዊ ደረጃ ከይህልዎም ኣይከኣሉን።,ደራሲ ቁልፊ ዝርዝራት ብኸመይ ተረዲእዎ?,እታ ደቀባት ኣመሪካዊት ጓል ኣንስተይቲ ንወፍሪ ሉዊስን ክላርክን ኣብ ምዕራብ ከመይ ጌራ ትትርጉምን መሪሓን?,ከከም ስርዓተ ዘመድ ቀቢላ እታ ሰበይቲ፡ ደቆም ናብቲ ቀቢላ ብውሑድ ብብዙሕ ብቐሊሉ ይውሃሃዱ ምተገብኡ።,ከከም ስርዓተ ዘመድ ቀቢላ እታ ሰበይቲ፡ ደቆም ናብቲ ቀቢላ ብውሑድ ብብዙሕ ብቐሊሉ ይውሃሃዱ ነበሩ።,ሓቂ ግን ከኣ ዘይቅኑዕ መልሲ ነዚ ዝስዕብ ሕቶ ኣብቲ ክፍሊ ተመርኲሱ
"In 1430 with the Privileges of Jedlnia, confirmed at Kraków in 1433 (Polish: 'przywileje jedlneńsko-krakowskie'), based partially on his earlier Brześć Kujawski privilege (April 25, 1425), King Władysław II Jagiełło granted the nobility a guarantee against arbitrary arrest, similar to the English Magna Carta's Habeas corpus, known from its own Latin name as 'neminem captivabimus (nisi jure victum).' Henceforth no member of the nobility could be imprisoned without a warrant from a court of justice: the king could neither punish nor imprison any noble at his whim.

"The Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT) is by far the largest Protestant denomination in Taiwan, with some 238,372 members as of 2009 (including a majority of the island's aborigines). English Presbyterian missionary James Laidlaw Maxwell established the first Presbyterian church in Tainan in 1865. His colleague George Leslie Mackay, of the Canadian Presbyterian Mission, was active in Danshui and north Taiwan from 1872 to 1901; he founded the island's first university and hospital, and created a written script for Taiwanese Minnan. The English and Canadian missions joined together as the PCT in 1912. One of the few churches permitted to operate in Taiwan through the era of Japanese rule (1895–1945), the PCT experienced rapid growth during the era of Guomindang-imposed martial law (1949–1987), in part due to its support for democracy, human rights, and Taiwan independence.

"Avicenna's psychology requires that connection between the body and soul be strong enough to ensure the soul's individuation, but weak enough to allow for its immortality. Avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology, which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception. Thus, the philosopher's connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception; in this way, bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect. In sense perception, the perceiver senses the form of the object; first, by perceiving features of the object by our external senses. This sensory information is supplied to the internal senses, which merge all the pieces into a whole, unified conscious experience. This process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body, for the material body may only perceive material objects, while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial, universal forms. The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction, which takes place in the physical body.",1,What is the key to a relationship and interaction between the physical body and the body?,"The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction, which takes place in the physical body.",a plausible but incorrect answer for the following question based on the passage,The distractor must be contextually relevant but must NOT be the correct answer.,"In the passage, the distractor must be contextually relevant but must NOT be the correct answer.",1,ስነ-ልቦና ኣቪቸና ኣብ መንጎ ኣካልን ነፍስን ምትእስሳር፡ ንውልቀት ነፍሲ ንምርግጋጽ እኹል ሓያል ክኸውን ይጠልብ፡ ግን ከኣ ዘይመውትራውነታ ዘፍቅድ ድኹም እዩ። ኣቪቸና ንስነ-ልቦኑ ኣብ ፊዚዮሎጂ መሰረት ብምግባር፡ እዚ ማለት ድማ ​​ብዛዕባ ነፍሲ ዝገልጽ ጸብጻቡ ዳርጋ ምሉእ ብምሉእ ምስ ተፈጥሮኣዊ ስነ-ፍልጠት ኣካልን ናይ ምርዳእ ዓቕሙን ዝዛመድ እዩ። በዚ ኸምዚ፡ እቲ ፈላስፋ ኣብ መንጎ ነፍስን ስጋን ዘለዎ ምትእስሳር ዳርጋ ብምሉኡ ብዛዕባ ኣረኣእያ ብምርድዳኡ እዩ ዚግለጽ፤ በዚ መንገዲ እዚ፡ ኣካላዊ ኣረኣእያ ምስቲ ዘይንዋታዊ ኣእምሮ ሰብ ይተሓሓዝ። ብኣረኣእያ ትርጉም እቲ ዝግንዘብ መልክዕ ናይቲ ኣቕሓ ይስምዖ፤ ቀዳማይ፡ ባህርያት ናይቲ ኣቕሓ ብግዳማዊ ህዋሳትና ብምርዳድ። እዚ ህዋሳዊ ሓበሬታ እዚ ንውሽጣዊ ህዋሳት ዝቐርብ ኮይኑ፡ ንኹሉ እቲ ቁራጽ ናብ ሓደ ምሉእን ውሁድ ንቕሓት ዘለዎ ተመክሮ ዘዋህለለ እዩ። እዚ መስርሕ ርድኢትን ርጡብነትን እዚ ንዋታዊ ኣካል ንዋታዊ ኣቕሑ ጥራይ ክርድኦ ስለ ዝኽእል፡ እቲ ዘይንዋታዊን ኣድማሳውን ቅርጽታት ጥራይ ክቕበል ስለ ዝኽእል፡ ንዋታዊ ኣካል ጥራይ ስለ ዝርድኦ፡ ናይ ነፍስን ስጋን ምትእስሳር እዩ። እቲ ነፍስን ኣካልን ኣብቲ ናይ መወዳእታ ርጡብነት ናይቲ ኣድማሳዊ ካብቲ ጭቡጥ ፍሉይ ዝራኸበሉ ኣገባብ፡ ነቲ ኣብቲ ስጋዊ ኣካል ዝፍጸም ርክቦምን ምትእስሳሮምን ቁልፊ እዩ።,ኣብ መንጎ ስጋዊ ኣካልን ኣካልን ንዘሎ ርክብን ምትእስሳርን እንታይ እዩ ቁልፊ እንታይ እዩ?,እቲ ነፍስን ኣካልን ኣብቲ ናይ መወዳእታ ርጡብነት ናይቲ ኣድማሳዊ ካብቲ ጭቡጥ ፍሉይ ዝራኸበሉ ኣገባብ፡ ነቲ ኣብቲ ስጋዊ ኣካል ዝፍጸም ርክቦምን ምትእስሳሮምን ቁልፊ እዩ።,ኣብቲ ክፍሊ ተመርኲሱ ነዚ ዝስዕብ ሕቶ ዝኸውን ኣእማኒ ግን ከኣ ዘይቅኑዕ መልሲ,እቲ ምዝንጋዕ ኣብ ጽሑፍ ኣገዳሲ ክኸውን ኣለዎ ግን ቅኑዕ መልሲ ክኸውን የብሉን።,ኣብቲ ክፍሊ፡ እቲ ምዝንጋዕ ኣብ ውሽጢ ጽሑፍ ኣገዳሲ ክኸውን ኣለዎ ግን ቅኑዕ መልሲ ክኸውን የብሉን።

"In 1983, the International Telecommunication Union's radio telecommunications sector (ITU-R) set up a working party (IWP11/6) with the aim of setting a single international HDTV standard. One of the thornier issues concerned a suitable frame/field refresh rate, the world already having split into two camps, 25/50 Hz and 30/60 Hz, largely due to the differences in mains frequency. The IWP11/6 working party considered many views and throughout the 1980s served to encourage development in a number of video digital processing areas, not least conversion between the two main frame/field rates using motion vectors, which led to further developments in other areas.

"The cult centers of Apollo in Greece, Delphi and Delos, date from the 8th century BCE. The Delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to Artemis, Apollo's twin sister. At Delphi, Apollo was venerated as the slayer of Pytho. For the Greeks, Apollo was all the Gods in one and through the centuries he acquired different functions which could originate from different gods. In archaic Greece he was the prophet, the oracular god who in older times was connected with 'healing'. In classical Greece he was the god of light and of music, but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil.

"During the summer months, it is common for temperatures to reach over 90 °F (32 °C), with an average of 106.5 days per year, including a majority from June to September, with a high of 90 °F or above and 4.6 days at or over 100 °F (38 °C). However, humidity usually yields a higher heat index. Summer mornings average over 90 percent relative humidity. Winds are often light in the summer and offer little relief, except in the far southeastern outskirts near the Gulf coast and Galveston. To cope with the strong humidity and heat, people use air conditioning in nearly every vehicle and building. In 1980, Houston was described as the 'most air-conditioned place on earth'.

When they defeated the Byzantine Armies in Egypt, the Arabs brought Sunni Islam to the country.

"Glacial bodies larger than 50,000 km2 (19,000 sq mi) are called ice sheets or continental glaciers. Several kilometers deep, they obscure the underlying topography. Only nunataks protrude from their surfaces. The only extant ice sheets are the two that cover most of Antarctica and Greenland. They contain vast quantities of fresh water, enough that if both melted, global sea levels would rise by over 70 m (230 ft). Portions of an ice sheet or cap that extend into water are called ice shelves; they tend to be thin with limited slopes and reduced velocities. Narrow, fast-moving sections of an ice sheet are called ice streams. In Antarctica, many ice streams drain into large ice shelves.

"Although professional wrestling in Mexico (lucha libre) also has stories and characters, they are less emphasized. Wrestlers in Mexico are traditionally more agile and perform more aerial maneuvers than professional wrestlers in the U.S. who, more often, rely on power moves and strikes to subdue their opponents. The difference in styles is due to the independent evolution of the sport in Mexico beginning in the 1930s and the fact that wrestlers in the cruiserweight division (peso semicompleto) are often the most popular wrestlers in Mexican lucha libre. Wrestlers often execute high flying moves characteristic of lucha libre by utilizing the wrestling ring's ropes to catapult themselves towards their opponents, using intricate combinations in rapid-fire succession, and applying complex submission holds.

"Managers in the Premier League are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection, and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans. Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA 'B' and 'A' Licences.

"Phillip Bard contributed to the theory with his work on animals. Bard found that sensory, motor, and physiological information all had to pass through the diencephalon (particularly the thalamus), before being subjected to any further processing. Therefore, Cannon also argued that it was not anatomically possible for sensory events to trigger a physiological response prior to triggering conscious awareness and emotional stimuli had to trigger both physiological and experiential aspects of emotion simultaneously.",2,question: What science did Phillip Bard study during his work?,the diencephalon,animal analysis,animal hypothesis,animal,4,ፊሊፕ ባርድ ኣብ እንስሳታት ብዝሰርሖ ስራሕ ነቲ ክልሰ-ሓሳብ ኣበርክቶ ገይሩ። ባርድ፡ ህዋሳት፡ ሞተርን ፊዚዮሎጂካዊ ሓበሬታን ኩሎም ቅድሚ ዝኾነ ተወሳኺ መስርሕ ቅድሚ ምግጣሞም፡ ብዲየንሰፋሎን (ብፍላይ ታላመስ) ክሓልፍዎ ከም ዝነበሮም ረኺቡ። ስለዚ፡ ካኖን፡ ቅድሚ ንንቕሓት ንቕሓትን ስምዒታዊ ምልዕዓላትን ቅድሚ ምብጋሱ፡ ህዋሳዊ ፍጻመታት ስነ-ኣካላዊ ምላሽ ንምብጋስ ብኣናቶሚያዊ ኣገባብ ከም ዘይከኣል ይምጉት ነይሩ፡ ንኽልቲኡ ስነ-ኣካላውን ተመኩሮኣውን መዳያት ስምዒት ብሓንሳብ ከበግስ ከም ዝነበሮ እውን ተማጒቱ።,ሕቶ፡ ፊሊፕ ባርድ ኣብ እዋን ስርሑ እንታይ ሳይንስ እዩ ተማሂሩ?,እቲ ዲየንስፋሎን .,ትንተና እንስሳ,ናይ እንስሳ መግመቲ,እንስሳ

"Over subsequent centuries, many Presbyterian churches modified these prescriptions by introducing hymnody, instrumental accompaniment, and ceremonial vestments into worship. However, there is not one fixed 'Presbyterian' worship style. Although there are set services for the 'Lord's Day', one can find a service to be evangelical and even revivalist in tone (especially in some conservative denominations), or strongly liturgical, approximating the practices of Lutheranism or Anglicanism (especially where Scottish tradition is esteemed),[clarification needed] or semi-formal, allowing for a balance of hymns, preaching, and congregational participation (favored by probably most American Presbyterians). Most Presbyterian churches follow the traditional liturgical year and observe the traditional holidays, holy seasons, such as Advent, Christmas, Ash Wednesday, Holy Week, Easter, Pentecost, etc. They also make use of the appropriate seasonal liturgical colors, etc. Many, incorporate ancient liturgical prayers and responses into the communion services and follow a daily, seasonal, and festival lectionary.

The Seleucid–Parthian wars continued as the Seleucids invaded Mesopotamia under Antiochus VII Sidetes (r. 138–129 BC), but he was eventually killed by a Parthian counterattack. After the fall of the Seleucid dynasty, the Parthians fought frequently against neighbouring Rome in the Roman–Parthian Wars (66 BC – 217 AD). Abundant traces of Hellenism continued under the Parthian empire. The Parthians used Greek as well as their own Parthian language (though lesser than Greek) as languages of administration and also used Greek drachmas as coinage. They enjoyed Greek theater and Greek art influenced Parthian art. The Parthians continued worhipping Greek gods syncretized together with Iranian deities.

"Among Richmond's most interesting architectural features is its Cast-iron architecture. Second only to New Orleans in its concentration of cast iron work, the city is home to a unique collection of cast iron porches, balconies, fences, and finials. Richmond's position as a center of iron production helped to fuel its popularity within the city. At the height of production in the 1890, 25 foundries operated in the city employing nearly 3,500 metal workers. This number is seven times the number of general construction workers being employed in Richmond at the time which illustrates the importance of its iron exports. Porches and fences in urban neighborhoods such as Jackson Ward, Church Hill, and Monroe Ward are particularly elaborate, often featuring ornate iron casts never replicated outside of Richmond. In some cases cast were made for a single residential or commercial application.",2,"Using the following passage, you can generate a high-quality multiple-choice question based on the following passage.",What is a credible but incorrect answer to the cast iron question?,"Using the following passage, you can generate a high-quality multiple-choice question based on the passage.","During a large gathering of cast iron, you can generate a high-quality multiple-choice question based on the passage.",What does Richmond's cast iron architecture contain?,4,"ካብቶም ኣብ ሪችሞንድ ኣዝዮም መሳጢ ዝኾኑ ስነ-ህንጻዊ መልክዕ፡ ስነ-ህንጻ ካስት-ኣይሮን ዝበሃል ስነ-ህንጻ ኣለዎ። ካልኣይቲ ካብ ኒው ኦርሊንስ ጥራይ ኣብ ምትእኽኻብ ናይ ቅንጥብጣብ ሓጺን ስራሕ፡ እታ ከተማ ፍሉይ እኩብ ድምር በረንዳታት ሓጺን፡ ባርኮኒ፡ ሓጹርን ፊኒያላትን ዝሓዘት እያ። ሪችሞንድ ከም ማእከል ምፍራይ ሓጺን ዘለዎ መርገጺ ኣብ ውሽጢ እታ ከተማ ዘለዋ ተፈታውነት ነዳዲ ንምሃብ ሓጊዙ። ኣብ 1890 ኣብ ዝለዓለ ጥርዙ ዝበጽሐ፡ 25 ፋውንድሪታት ኣብታ ከተማ ዝንቀሳቐሱ ኣስታት 3,500 ሰራሕተኛታት ሓጺን ዝቖጽሩ እዮም። እዚ ቁጽሪ እዚ፡ ኣብቲ እዋን ኣብ ሪችሞንድ ዝቖጽሩ ዘለዉ ሓፈሻዊ ሰራሕተኛታት ህንጻ፡ ኣገዳስነት ሰደድ ሓጺናዊ ሰደድኡ ዘርኢ ቁጽሪ ሸውዓተ ዕጽፊ እዩ። ኣብ ከም በዓል ጃክሰን ዋርድ፡ ቸርች ሂልን ሞንሮ ዋርድን ዝኣመሰሉ ናይ ከተማ ከባቢታት በረንዳታትን ሓጹራትን ብፍላይ ዝተራቐቑ ኮይኖም፡ መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ካብ ሪችሞንድ ወጻኢ ዘይተደጋገሙ ውቁባት ብሓጺን ዝተሰርሑ ካስትታት ዝሓዘ እዩ። ኣብ ገለ ገለ ኣጋጣሚታት ንሓደ መንበሪ ወይ ንግዳዊ መመልከቲ ዝኸውን ዝተደርበየ እዩ።",ነዚ ዝስዕብ ክፍሊ ብምጥቃም፡ ኣብዚ ዝስዕብ ክፍሊ ተመርኲስካ ልዑል ጽሬት ዘለዎ ብዙሕ ምርጫ ዘለዎ ሕቶ ከተምጽእ ትኽእል።,ተኣማንነት ዘለዎ ግን ከኣ ዘይቅኑዕ መልሲ ንሕቶ ካስት ኣይሮን እንታይ እዩ?,ነዚ ዝስዕብ ክፍሊ ብምጥቃም፡ ኣብቲ ክፍሊ ተመርኲስካ ልዑል ጽሬት ዘለዎ ብዙሕ ምርጫ ዘለዎ ሕቶ ከተምጽእ ትኽእል።,ኣብ እዋን ዓቢ ምትእኽኻብ ናይ ቅንጥብጣብ ሓጺን፡ ኣብቲ ክፍሊ ተመርኲስካ ልዑል ጽሬት ዘለዎ ብዙሕ ምርጫ ዘለዎ ሕቶ ከተምጽእ ትኽእል ኢኻ።,ሪችሞንድ ዝሰርሖ ናይ ሓጺን ስነ ህንጻ ​​እንታይ ይሕዝ?
"At the 1912 Salon d'Automne an architectural installation was exhibited that quickly became known as Maison Cubiste (Cubist House), signed Raymond Duchamp-Villon and André Mare along with a group of collaborators. Metzinger and Gleizes in Du 'Cubisme', written during the assemblage of the 'Maison Cubiste', wrote about the autonomous nature of art, stressing the point that decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art. Decorative work, to them, was the 'antithesis of the picture'. 'The true picture' wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, 'bears its raison d'être within itself. It can be moved from a church to a drawing-room, from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism...'. 'Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence', writes Christopher Green, 'creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends Léger and Roger La Fresnaye'. La Maison Cubiste was a fully furnished house, with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room—the Salon Bourgeois, where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (Woman with a Fan), Gleizes, Laurencin and Léger were hung—and a bedroom. It was an example of L'art décoratif, a home within which Cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life. Spectators at the Salon d'Automne passed through the full-scale 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the ground floor of the facade, designed by Duchamp-Villon.

"In quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, the vacuum is defined as the state (that is, the solution to the equations of the theory) with the lowest possible energy (the ground state of the Hilbert space). In quantum electrodynamics this vacuum is referred to as 'QED vacuum' to distinguish it from the vacuum of quantum chromodynamics, denoted as QCD vacuum. QED vacuum is a state with no matter particles (hence the name), and also no photons. As described above, this state is impossible to achieve experimentally. (Even if every matter particle could somehow be removed from a volume, it would be impossible to eliminate all the blackbody photons.)

In the aftermath, Philip formed the League of Corinth, effectively bringing the majority of Greece under his direct sway.

"Quantum dots (QD) are semiconductor nanocrystals that possess unique optical properties. Their emission color can be tuned from the visible throughout the infrared spectrum. This allows quantum dot LEDs to create almost any color on the CIE diagram. This provides more color options and better color rendering than white LEDs since the emission spectrum is much narrower, characteristic of quantum confined states. There are two types of schemes for QD excitation. One uses photo excitation with a primary light source LED (typically blue or UV LEDs are used).

"Muslim sects regarded as heretical, such as the Druze, Ismailis, Alevis, and Alawites, ranked below Jews and Christians. In 1514, Sultan Selim I, nicknamed 'the Grim' because of his cruelty, ordered the massacre of 40,000 Anatolian Alevis (Qizilbash), whom he considered heretics, reportedly proclaiming that 'the killing of one Alevi had as much otherworldly reward as killing 70 Christians.'[page needed] Selim was also responsible for an unprecedented and rapid expansion of the Ottoman Empire into the Middle East, especially through his conquest of the entire Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt, which included much of the region. With these conquests, Selim further solidified the Ottoman claim for being an Islamic caliphate, although Ottoman sultans had been claiming the title of caliph since the 14th century starting with Murad I (reigned 1362 to 1389). The caliphate would remain held by Ottoman sultans for the rest of the office's duration, which ended with its abolition on 3 March 1924 by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and the exile of the last caliph, Abdülmecid II, to France.",1,What was the name of the high-quality multiple-choice question given?,What did Sultan Selim I make known as the Grim?,The Grim,What were the two major issues facing the Ottoman empire?,An incorrect answer for the following question based on the passage,2,"ከም መናፍቕነት ዝቑጸሩ ኣስላም ንፍቕሪ ከም ድሩዘ፡ እስማዒላውያን፡ ኣለቪስን ኣላዋውያንን ዝኣመሰሉ፡ ኣብ ትሕቲ ኣይሁድን ክርስትያንን ተሰሪዖም ይርከቡ። ኣብ 1514፡ ሱልጣን ሰሊም ቀዳማይ፡ ብሰንኪ ጭካነ 'ዘ ግሪም' ዝብል ሳጓ ዝሃበ፡ ነቲ መናፍቓን ዝቖጸሮ 40,000 ኣናቶልያዊ ኣለቪስ (QIZILBASH) ዝበሃል መናፍቓን ዝቖጸረ፡ 'እቲ ምቕታል ሓደ ኣሎቪ ከም ምስፍፍራድ ከም ዝቐተለ 70 ክርስትያን ከም ዝቐተለ ኸም ዝቐተለ ምእዋጅ ከም ዝኣወጀ ይእውጅ። ናይ ኦቶማን ግዝኣት ናብ ማእከላይ ምብራቕ ብፍላይ ድማ ብመላእ ማምሉክ ሱልጣንነት ግብጺ ብዝወረሮ ምውራር፡ እዚ ድማ ንመብዛሕትኡ ክፋል ናይቲ ዞባ ዘጠቓለለ እዩ። ምስዚ ስዕረታት እዚ፡ ሰሊም ነቲ ኦቶማን ዝብል ክሲ፡ እስላማዊ ካሊፋት ምዃኑ ዝያዳ ኣጽኒዑዎ፡ ዋላ’ኳ ኦቶማን ሱልጣን ካብ 14 ክፍለ ዘመን ጀሚሩ ካብ ሙራድ I (1362 ክሳብ 1389 ዝነጸገ) ካብ መበል 14 ክፍለ ዘመን ጀሚሩ ናይ ከሊፋ መዓርግ ክሓትት እንተጸንሐ’ኳ እንተነበረ። እቲ ካሊፋት ብ3 መጋቢት 1924 ብዓቢ ሃገራዊ ባይቶ ቱርኪን ስደት ናይቲ ናይ መወዳእታ ከሊፋን abdülmeciD II, ናብ ፈረንሳ ብምድራዙ ብምትሕውዋሱ ብ3 መጋቢት 1924 ብኦቶማን ሱልጣንስ ተታሒዙ ክጸንሕ እዩ።",ስም ናይቲ ልዑል ጽሬት ዘለዎ ብዙሕ ምርጫታት ዝሃበ ሕቶ እንታይ እዩ?,ሱልጣን ሰሊም እንታይ እዩ እቲ ግሪም ዝፈልጦ?,እቲ ጽምዋ .,ንኢምፓየር ኦቶማን ዘጋጥሞም ክልተ ዓበይቲ ጉዳያት እንታይ እዮም ነይሮም?,ኣብቲ ክፍሊ ተመርኲሱ ነዚ ዝስዕብ ሕቶ ዘይቅኑዕ መልሲ
"Kenneth Gergen formulated additional classifications, which include the strategic manipulator, the pastiche personality, and the relational self. The strategic manipulator is a person who begins to regard all senses of identity merely as role-playing exercises, and who gradually becomes alienated from his or her social 'self'. The pastiche personality abandons all aspirations toward a true or 'essential' identity, instead viewing social interactions as opportunities to play out, and hence become, the roles they play. Finally, the relational self is a perspective by which persons abandon all sense of exclusive self, and view all sense of identity in terms of social engagement with others. For Gergen, these strategies follow one another in phases, and they are linked to the increase in popularity of postmodern culture and the rise of telecommunications technology.",2,What does Kenneth Gergen think is crucial to his understanding of key details from the text?,"The pastiche personality, and the relational self?",what is the correct answer?,The distractor must be contextually relevant but must NOT be the correct answer?,The distractor must be contextually relevant but must NOT be the correct answer.,1,"ኬነት ገርገን ተወሳኺ ምደባታት ሓንጸጸ፣ እዚ ድማ ስትራተጂካዊ ማኒፑለተር፣ ፓስቲች ስብእና፣ ከምኡ እውን ዝምድናዊ ነብስኻ ዘጠቓልል እዩ። እቲ ስትራተጂካዊ ምትላል ንኹሉ ናይ መንነት ህዋሳት ከም ተራ ምጽዋት ጥራይ ክቖጽሮ ዝጅምር ሰብ እዩ፣ በብቑሩብ ድማ ካብ ማሕበራዊ 'ርእሱ' ይጓየ። እቲ ናይ ፓስቲሽ ስብእና ንኹሉ ናብ ሓቀኛ ወይ 'ኣገዳሲ' መንነት ዝግበር ባህግታት ይገድፎ፣ ኣብ ክንድኡ ማሕበራዊ ምትእስሳር ከም ዕድላት ናይ ምጽዋት፣ ስለዚ ድማ፣ ነቲ ዝጻወትዎ ተራታት ይርእዮ። ኣብ መወዳእታ፡ እቲ ዝምድናዊ ነብሰይ፡ ሰባት ንኹሉ ናይ ፍሉይ ርእሰ-ምትእምማን ስምዒት ዝገድፉሉ ኣረኣእያ ኮይኑ፡ ንኹሉ ናይ መንነት ስምዒት ብመንጽር ማሕበራዊ ምትእስሳር ምስ ካልኦት ዝጥምትሉ ኣረኣእያ እዩ። ንገርገን፡ እዞም ስትራተጂታት እዚኣቶም ኣብ ምዕራፋት ንሓድሕዶም ይስዕቡ፡ ምስ ምውሳኽ ህቡብነት ድሕረ-ዘመናዊ ባህልን ምልዓል ቴክኖሎጂ ቴሌኮሙኒኬሽንን ዝተኣሳሰሩ እዮም።",ኬነት ገርገን ካብቲ ጽሑፍ ንዝመጽእ ቁልፊ ዝርዝራት ንምርዳእ ወሳኒ እንታይ እዩ ኢሉ ዝሓስብ?,እቲ ፓስቲሽ ስብእና፣ ከምኡውን እቲ ዝምድናዊ ነብስኻ?,ቅኑዕ መልሲ እንታይ እዩ?,እቲ ምዝንጋዕ ኣብ ትሕቲ ጽሑፍ ኣገዳሲ ክኸውን ኣለዎ ግን ቅኑዕ መልሲ ክኸውን የብሉን?,እቲ ምዝንጋዕ ኣብ ጽሑፍ ኣገዳሲ ክኸውን ኣለዎ ግን ቅኑዕ መልሲ ክኸውን የብሉን።

"Prior to the 20th century drugs were generally produced by small scale manufacturers with little regulatory control over manufacturing or claims of safety and efficacy. To the extent that such laws did exist, enforcement was lax. In the United States, increased regulation of vaccines and other biological drugs was spurred by tetanus outbreaks and deaths caused by the distribution of contaminated smallpox vaccine and diphtheria antitoxin. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 required that federal government grant premarket approval for every biological drug and for the process and facility producing such drugs. This was followed in 1906 by the Pure Food and Drugs Act, which forbade the interstate distribution of adulterated or misbranded foods and drugs. A drug was considered misbranded if it contained alcohol, morphine, opium, cocaine, or any of several other potentially dangerous or addictive drugs, and if its label failed to indicate the quantity or proportion of such drugs. The government's attempts to use the law to prosecute manufacturers for making unsupported claims of efficacy were undercut by a Supreme Court ruling restricting the federal government's enforcement powers to cases of incorrect specification of the drug's ingredients.",2,Choosing an answer to the question should test the reader's understanding of key details from the text.,a plausible but incorrect answer for the following question based on the passage,Where can a distractor not be a correct answer?,The Biologics Control Act of 1902 required that federal government grant premarket approval for every biological drug and for the process and facility producing such drugs?,Did the distractor need contextually relevant but must NOT be the correct answer?,3,ቅድሚ መበል 20 ክፍለ ዘመን መድሃኒታት ብሓፈሻ ብንኣሽቱ ኣፍረይቲ ዝፍረዩ ኮይኖም ኣብ ልዕሊ ማኑፋክቸሪንግ ወይ ናይ ድሕነትን ውጽኢታዊነትን ክሲ ውሑድ ምቁጽጻር ዘለዎም እዮም። ከምዚ ዝኣመሰለ ሕግታት ክሳብ ዝነበረ፡ ምትግባር ላሕሊ እዩ ነይሩ። ኣብ ኣሜሪካ፡ ምውሳኽ ምቁጽጻር ክታበትን ካልእ ስነ-ህይወታዊ መድሃኒታትን ብሰንኪ ብከላ ዝተበከለ ክታበት ፍንጣጣን ዲፍተርያ ኣንቲቶክሲንን ብዝተፈጥረ ለበዳ ቴታነስን ሞትን ተነቓቒሑ። እቲ ናይ 1902 ሕጊ ምቁጽጻር ባዮሎጂክስ፡ ፌደራል መንግስቲ ንነፍሲ ​​ወከፍ ስነ-ህይወታዊ መድሃኒት ቅድመ-ዕዳጋ ፍቓድ ምሃብን ከምኡ’ውን ንኸምዚ ዝኣመሰለ መድሃኒት ዘፍሪ መስርሕን መሳለጥያታትን ክህብ ይጠልብ ነይሩ። እዚ ስዒቡ ኣብ 1906 ሕጊ ጽሩይ መግብን መድሃኒትን፡ እዚ ሕጊ እዚ፡ ኣብ መንጎ ግዝኣታት ንዝፍለጡ ወይ ብጌጋ ዝተሰረተ መግቢን ዕጸፋርስን ምክፍፋል ዝኽልክል እዩ። ሓደ መድሃኒት፡ ኣልኮላዊ መስተ፡ ሞርፊን፡ ዕፉን፡ ኮኬይን፡ ወይ ዝኾነ ካብ ካልኦት ሓያሎ ሓደገኛታት ወይ ወልፊ ዘለዎም መድሃኒታት፡ ስያመኡ ብዝሒ ወይ ብዝሒ ናይ ከምዚ ዝኣመሰለ መድሃኒት ከመልክት እንተዘይክኢሉ፡ ከም ጌጋ ምልክት ተገይሩሉ ይቑጸር ነይሩ። መንግስቲ ነቲ ሕጊ ንምጥቃም ዝገበሮ ፈተነ ንኣፍረይቲ ንዘይተገዝኦ ናይ ውጽኢታዊነት ክሲ ንኽቐርብ ንምኽሳስ ዝገበሮ ፈተነ፡ ነቲ ናይ ፌደራል መንግስቲ ናይ ምትግባር ስልጣን ኣብ ዘይቅኑዕ ዝርዝር ቀመማት ናይቲ መድሃኒት ዝድርት ጉዳያት ብምግዳብ ላዕለዋይ ቤት ፍርዲ ዝሃበ ውሳነ ላዕለዋይ ቤት ፍርዲ ተገዲዱ።,መልሲ ናይቲ ሕቶ ምምራጽ፡ ኣንባቢ ብዛዕባ ቁልፊ ዝርዝራት ካብቲ ጽሑፍ ዘለዎ ርድኢት ክፍትን ይግባእ።,ኣብቲ ክፍሊ ተመርኲሱ ነዚ ዝስዕብ ሕቶ ዝኸውን ኣእማኒ ግን ከኣ ዘይቅኑዕ መልሲ,ሓደ ትኩረት ዝሰርቕ ቅኑዕ መልሲ ዘይከውን ኣበይ ክኸውን ይኽእል?,እቲ ናይ 1902 ዓ.ም ሕጊ ምቁጽጻር ባዮሎጂክስ ፌደራል መንግስቲ ንነፍሲ ​​ወከፍ ስነ-ህይወታዊ መድሓኒትን ንመስርሕን መሳለጥያታትን ከምዚ ዓይነት መድሃኒት ዘፍሪ መስርሕን ቅድመ ዕዳጋ ፍቓድ ክህብ ይጠልብ ነይሩ?,እቲ ምዝንጋዕ ኣብ ትሕቲ ጽሑፋዊ ርክብ ዘድልዮ ድዩ ግን ቅኑዕ መልሲ ክኸውን የብሉን?

"The Roman Empire reached its greatest territorial extent during the 2nd century AD; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories. Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to make the 3rd century politically unstable, with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during the 3rd century, mainly in response to the war with Sassanid Persia, which revived in the middle of the 3rd century. The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns. More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.",1,Answer:,The distractor must be contextually relevant but must NOT be the correct answer?,The Roman Empire reached its greatest territorial extent during the 2nd century AD,The distractor must be contextually relevant but MUST NOT be the correct answer,True but incorrect answer,2,ግዝኣት ሮማ ኣብ 2ይ ክፍለ ዘመን ድሕሪ ልደተ ክርስቶስ ዝዓበየ ግዝኣታዊ ስፍሓቱ በጺሑ፤ ኣብ ዝቐጸላ ክልተ ዘመናት፡ ሮማውያን ኣብ ልዕሊ’ቲ ኣብ መወዳእታኡ ዝነበረ ግዝኣታታ ዝነበረ ምዝሕሓል ምንቁልቋል ርእዮም። ቁጠባዊ ጉዳያት፡ እንተላይ ዋጋታት ንብረት፡ ከምኡ’ውን ግዳማዊ ጸቕጢ ኣብ ዶባት ተደሚሩ ን3ይ ክፍለ ዘመን ፖለቲካዊ ዘይርጉእ ንምግባር ተደሚሩ፡ ሃጸያት ናብ ዝፋን ክመጹ ከለዉ ብሓድሽ መጉልሒ ድምጺ ብቕልጡፍ ክትክኡ ጥራይ እዮም። ኣብ 3ይ ክፍለ ዘመን ወተሃደራዊ ወጻኢታት ብቐጻሊ እናወሰኸ ከደ፣ እዚ ድማ ብቐንዱ ምስቲ ኣብ መፋርቕ 3ይ ክፍለ ዘመን ዳግማይ ዘበራበረ ሳሳኒድ ፐርስያ ነቲ ኲናት ምላሽ ንምሃብ እዩ። እቲ ሰራዊት ብዓቐን ብዕጽፊ ወሲኹ፡ ፈረሰኛታትን ንኣሽቱ ኣሃዱታትን ድማ ንሌጅዮን ከም ቀንዲ ታክቲካዊ ኣሃዱ ተኪእዎም። ኣድላይነት ኣታዊታት ምውሳኽ ግብሪን ቁጽሪ ናይቲ ኣብ ትውልዲ ከተማታት ስልጣን ምሓዝ ጾር ኣብ መንኵቡ ኣብ መንኵቡ ድልዋት ካብኣቶም ድልዋት ዝኾኑ ቁጽሮም ምንካይን ክውስኽን ቁጽሮምን ናይቲ ምሕዋይ፡ ወይ መሬት፡ ደርቢን ምንካይን ኣስዒቡ። ኣብ ማእከላይ ምምሕዳር ንጠለባት እቲ ሰራዊት ንምግጣም ዝያዳ ቢሮክራታት የድሊ ነበረ፣ እዚ ድማ ካብ ሰላማውያን ሰባት ጥርዓን ኣስዒቡ ኣብቲ ግዝኣት ካብ ግብሪ ዝኸፍሉ ንላዕሊ ግብሪ ዝእክቡ ሰባት ከም ዝእከቡ ገይርዎም።,መልሲ፥,እቲ ምዝንጋዕ ኣብ ትሕቲ ጽሑፍ ኣገዳሲ ክኸውን ኣለዎ ግን ቅኑዕ መልሲ ክኸውን የብሉን?,ግዝኣት ሮማ ኣብ 2ይ ክፍለ ዘመን ዓ.ም.,እቲ ምዝንባል ኣብ ትሕቲ ጽሑፍ ኣገዳሲ ክኸውን ኣለዎ ግን ቅኑዕ መልሲ ክኸውን የብሉን ።,ሓቀኛ ግን ከኣ ዘይቅኑዕ መልሲ
"The treaty was published in the United States for the first time by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on May 22, 1946, in Britain by the Manchester Guardian. It was also part of an official State Department publication, Nazi–Soviet Relations 1939–1941, edited by Raymond J. Sontag and James S. Beddie in January 1948. The decision to publish the key documents on German–Soviet relations, including the treaty and protocol, had been taken already in spring 1947. Sontag and Beddie prepared the collection throughout the summer of 1947. In November 1947, President Truman personally approved the publication but it was held back in view of the Foreign Ministers Conference in London scheduled for December. Since negotiations at that conference did not prove constructive from an American point of view, the document edition was sent to press. The documents made headlines worldwide.

"'New Labour' was first termed as an alternative branding for the Labour Party, dating from a conference slogan first used by the Labour Party in 1994, which was later seen in a draft manifesto published by the party in 1996, called New Labour, New Life For Britain. It was a continuation of the trend that had begun under the leadership of Neil Kinnock.

"Broca, being what today would be called a neurosurgeon, had taken an interest in the pathology of speech. He wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals, which appeared to reside in speech. He discovered the speech center of the human brain, today called Broca's area after him. His interest was mainly in Biological anthropology, but a German philosopher specializing in psychology, Theodor Waitz, took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work, entitled Die Anthropologie der Naturvölker, 1859–1864.

These include organisms such as Myxococcus xanthus, which forms swarms of cells that kill and digest any bacteria they encounter. Other bacterial predators either attach to their prey in order to digest them and absorb nutrients, such as Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus, or invade another cell and multiply inside the cytosol, such as Daptobacter.

"The 10th century saw a mass migration of Turkic tribes from Central Asia into the Iranian plateau. Turkic tribesmen were first used in the Abbasid army as mamluks (slave-warriors), replacing Iranian and Arab elements within the army. As a result, the mamluks gained a significant political power. In 999, large portions of Iran came briefly under the rule of the Ghaznavids, whose rulers were of mamluk Turk origin, and longer subsequently under the Turkish Seljuk and Khwarezmian empires. These Turks had been Persianized and had adopted Persian models of administration and rulership. The Seljuks subsequently gave rise to the Sultanate of Rum in Anatolia, while taking their thoroughly Persianized identity with them. The result of the adoption and patronage of Persian culture by Turkish rulers was the development of a distinct Turko-Persian tradition.",1,Who did this test a reader's understanding of key details?,Turkey's rulers were a distinct Turko-Persian tradition?,the passage,The distractor must be contextually relevant but must NOT be the correct answer?,What must be contextually relevant?,1,መበል 10ይ ክፍለ ዘመን ካብ ማእከላይ ኤስያ ናብ ፕላቶ ኢራን ካብ ዝርከብ ቱርካዊ ቀቢላታት ጃምላዊ ስደት ርእዩ። ቀቢላታት ቱርኪ መጀመርያ ኣብ ሰራዊት ኣባሲድ ከም ማምሉክ (ባርያ-ዋሪየርስ) ተጠቒሞም ኣብ ውሽጢ እቲ ሰራዊት ኢራንን ዓረብን ባእታታት ተኪኦም እዮም። ከም ውጽኢቱ ድማ ማምሉክ ርኡይ ፖለቲካዊ ስልጣን ረኺቦም። ኣብ 999 ዓ.ም.ፈ ዓበይቲ ክፋላት ኢራን ብሓጺሩ ኣብ ትሕቲ ምምሕዳር ጋዝናቪድስ መጺኡ፣ ገዛእቲ መበቆል ማምሉክ ቱርኪ ዝነበሮም፣ ድሕሪኡ ድማ ኣብ ትሕቲ ቱርኪ ሰልጁክን ክዌርዝሚያን ሃጸያዊ ግዝኣታትን ዝነውሐ ግዜ። እዞም ቱርካውያን ፋርስያውያን ኮይኖም፡ ናይ ፋርሳዊ ሞዴላት ምምሕዳርን ገዛእትን ተቐቢሎም ነይሮም። ብድሕሪኡ እቶም ሰልጁክስ ኣብ ኣናቶልያ ሱልጣንነት ራም ክለዓሉ እንከለዉ፡ ምስኦም ድማ ብዕምቆት ፋርሳዊ መንነቶም እናወሰዱ። ውጽኢት ናይቲ ብገዛእ ርእሱ ቱርኪ ዝነበረ ባህሊ ፋርስ ምውሳድን ምሕጋዝን ፍሉይ ትውፊት ቱርኮ-ፐርስያዊ ምዕባለ እዩ ነይሩ።,እዚ ንሓደ ኣንባቢ ብዛዕባ ቁልፊ ዝርዝራት ዘለዎ ርድኢት መን እዩ ፈቲኑ?,ገዛእቲ ቱርኪ ፍሉይ ትውፊት ቱርኮ-ፐርስያን እዮም ነይሮም?,እቲ ክፍሊ .,እቲ ምዝንጋዕ ኣብ ትሕቲ ጽሑፍ ኣገዳሲ ክኸውን ኣለዎ ግን ቅኑዕ መልሲ ክኸውን የብሉን?,እንታይ እዩ ብዓውደ-ጽሑፍ ኣገዳሲ ክኸውን ዘለዎ?

"In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce 'unbreakable' children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.",2,What did the RCA Victor offer for long-term record delivery?,RCA Victor introduces a commercial or a commercial vinyl de luxe pressings?,What was the correct answer for the passage?,what happened to the Victrolac compound?,"RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price.",4,"ኣብ 1931 RCA Victor ንገለ ዘይተለምደ-ቅርጺን ፍሉይ ዕላማ ዘለዎን መዛግብቲ ከም ንብረት ከም ንብረት ኣብ ቫይነል ዝተመርኮሰ ቪክትሮላክ ውህደት ኣተኣታትዩ። ኣብ መወዳእታ ናይ 1930ታት ቪኒል ብልጫታት ቀሊል ክብደት፡ ኣንጻራዊ ዘይብሬን ትሑት ናይ ገጽ ድምጽን ንቅድመ-ተቐርጊሉ ሬድዮ ፕሮግራሚንግን ካልእ ወሳኒ መተግበሪታትን ምርጫ ንብረት ገይርዎ ነይሩ። ኣብ ተራ 78 rpm ክብረወሰን ምስ በጽሐ ግን፡ እቲ ኣዝዩ ዝለዓለ ወጻኢታት ናይቲ ጥረ ነገራት፡ ከምኡ’ውን ንከበድቲ ምልዓልን ብዘይድሩቕ ብጅምላ ዝተሰርሐ ብሓጺን ዝተሰርሐ መርፍእ ሓጺን ክሳብ ሕጂ ኣብ ናይ ገዛ መዝገብ ተጻወትቲ ዝጥቀመሉ ዝነበረ ተቓላዕነት፡ ኣብቲ እዋን’ቲ ንሸላክ ዘይተግባራዊ ዝኾነ ሓፈሻዊ ምትኽኻእ ገበሮ። ኣብ ካልኣይ ኲናት ዓለም፡ ዕጡቓት ሓይልታት ሕቡራት መንግስታት ኣመሪካ፡ እቶም ወተሃደራት ኣብ ወጻኢ ሃገራት ንኽጥቀሙ ኣሽሓት 12 ኢንች ዝቑመቱ ቪኒል 78 RPM V-Discs ኣፍረዩ። ድሕሪ እቲ ኲናት፡ እቲ ብሰፊሑ ቫይነል ምጥቃም፡ ብተዛማዲ ቀሊል ክብደት ዘለዎ ክሪስታል ፒካፕን ልክዕነት ዘለዎ መሬት ስታይሊን ካብ ሳፋየር ወይ ድማ ፍሉይ ዝኾነ ኦስሚየም ቅይሕ ዝበዝሖ ዝነበረ፡ ከም ሓደስቲ ተጻወትቲ ክብረወሰን ከም ሓደስቲ ክብረወሰን ዘለዎም ተጻወትቲ ከም ግብራዊ ኰነ። ኣብ መወዳእታ 1945 RCA ቪክቶር ፍሉይ ግሉጽ ዝኾነ ቀይሕ ቫይነል ደ ሉክስ ጸቕጢ ናይ ገለ ክላሲካል 78s ብዲ ሉክስ ዋጋ ክህብ ጀመረ። ድሒሩ፡ Decca Records ንቫይነል ደክካላይት 78s ኣተኣታትዩ፡ ካልኦት ናይ መዝገብ ኩባንያታት ድማ ከም MetroLite, Merco Plastic and Sav-O-Flex ዝኣመሰሉ ናይ ቫይነል ኮንኮክሽንስ ክመጹ ከለዉ፡ እዚኦም ግን ብቐንዱ 'ዘይተሰባበሩ' ናይ ህጻናት መዛግብትን ፍሉይ ቀጢን ቫይነል DJ ንምልኣኽ ናብ መደበራት ሬድዮ ንኽልኣኽ ዝጽቀጥ ፍሉይ ቀጢን ቪኒል DJን ንምፍራይ ይጥቀሙ ነይሮም።",RCA ቪክቶር ንነዊሕ እዋን ክብረወሰን ንምብጻሕ እንታይ ኣቕሪቡ?,RCA Victor ንግዳዊ ወይ ንግዳዊ ናይ ቪኒል ደ ሉክስ ጸቕጢ የተኣታቱ?,ነቲ ክፍሊ ቅኑዕ መልሲ እንታይ እዩ ነይሩ?,ኣብ ቀጽሪ ቪክትሮላክ እንታይ ኣጋጢምዎ?,RCA ቪክቶር ፍሉይ ግሉጽ ዝኾነ ቀይሕ ቪኒል ደ ሉክስ ጸቕጢ ናይ ገለ ክላሲካል 78s ከቕርብ ጀሚሩ፣ ብዲ ሉክስ ዋጋ።

"In the early 19th century, the role of Utrecht as a fortified town had become obsolete. The fortifications of the Nieuwe Hollandse Waterlinie were moved east of Utrecht. The town walls could now be demolished to allow for expansion. The moats remained intact and formed an important feature of the Zocher plantsoen, an English style landscape park that remains largely intact today. Growth of the city increased when, in 1843, a railway connecting Utrecht to Amsterdam was opened. After that, Utrecht gradually became the main hub of the Dutch railway network. With the industrial revolution finally gathering speed in the Netherlands and the ramparts taken down, Utrecht began to grow far beyond the medieval centre. In 1853, the Dutch government allowed the bishopric of Utrecht to be reinstated by Rome, and Utrecht became the centre of Dutch Catholicism once more. From the 1880s onward neighbourhoods such as Oudwijk, Wittevrouwen, Vogelenbuurt to the East, and Lombok to the West were developed. New middle class residential areas, such as Tuindorp and Oog in Al, were built in the 1920s and 1930s.

"Hebb distinguished between short-term and long-term memory. He postulated that any memory that stayed in short-term storage for a long enough time would be consolidated into a long-term memory. Later research showed this to be false. Research has shown that direct injections of cortisol or epinephrine help the storage of recent experiences. This is also true for stimulation of the amygdala. This proves that excitement enhances memory by the stimulation of hormones that affect the amygdala. Excessive or prolonged stress (with prolonged cortisol) may hurt memory storage.
