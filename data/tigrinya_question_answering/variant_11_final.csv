"Writing about Lee's style and use of humor in a tragic story, scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin states: 'Laughter ... [exposes] the gangrene under the beautiful surface but also by demeaning it; one can hardly ... be controlled by what one is able to laugh at.' Scout's precocious observations about her neighbors and behavior inspire National Endowment of the Arts director David Kipen to call her 'hysterically funny'. To address complex issues, however, Tavernier-Courbin notes that Lee uses parody, satire, and irony effectively by using a child's perspective. After Dill promises to marry her, then spends too much time with Jem, Scout reasons the best way to get him to pay attention to her is to beat him up, which she does several times. Scout's first day in school is a satirical treatment of education; her teacher says she must undo the damage Atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write, and forbids Atticus from teaching her further. Lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony, however, as Jem and Scout try to understand how Maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society.

In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations.

"Furthermore, despite the novel's thematic focus on racial injustice, its black characters are not fully examined. In its use of racial epithets, stereotyped depictions of superstitious blacks, and Calpurnia, who to some critics is an updated version of the 'contented slave' motif and to others simply unexplored, the book is viewed as marginalizing black characters. One writer asserts that the use of Scout's narration serves as a convenient mechanism for readers to be innocent and detached from the racial conflict. Scout's voice 'functions as the not-me which allows the rest of us—black and white, male and female—to find our relative position in society'.

"Solar concentrating technologies such as parabolic dish, trough and Scheffler reflectors can provide process heat for commercial and industrial applications. The first commercial system was the Solar Total Energy Project (STEP) in Shenandoah, Georgia, USA where a field of 114parabolic dishes provided 50% of the process heating, air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory. This grid-connected cogeneration system provided 400 kW of electricity plus thermal energy in the form of 401kW steam and 468 kW chilled water, and had a one-hour peak load thermal storage. Evaporation ponds are shallow pools that concentrate dissolved solids through evaporation. The use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from sea water is one of the oldest applications of solar energy. Modern uses include concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams. Clothes lines, clotheshorses, and clothes racks dry clothes through evaporation by wind and sunlight without consuming electricity or gas. In some states of the United States legislation protects the 'right to dry' clothes. Unglazed transpired collectors (UTC) are perforated sun-facing walls used for preheating ventilation air. UTCs can raise the incoming air temperature up to 22°C (40 °F) and deliver outlet temperatures of 45–60 °C (113–140 °F).

"Solar concentrating technologies such as parabolic dish, trough and Scheffler reflectors can provide process heat for commercial and industrial applications. The first commercial system was the Solar Total Energy Project (STEP) in Shenandoah, Georgia, USA where a field of 114parabolic dishes provided 50% of the process heating, air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory. This grid-connected cogeneration system provided 400 kW of electricity plus thermal energy in the form of 401kW steam and 468 kW chilled water, and had a one-hour peak load thermal storage. Evaporation ponds are shallow pools that concentrate dissolved solids through evaporation. The use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from sea water is one of the oldest applications of solar energy. Modern uses include concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams. Clothes lines, clotheshorses, and clothes racks dry clothes through evaporation by wind and sunlight without consuming electricity or gas. In some states of the United States legislation protects the 'right to dry' clothes. Unglazed transpired collectors (UTC) are perforated sun-facing walls used for preheating ventilation air. UTCs can raise the incoming air temperature up to 22°C (40 °F) and deliver outlet temperatures of 45–60 °C (113–140 °F). The short payback period of transpired collectors (3to 12years) makes them a more cost-effective alternative than glazed collection systems.

"Geography effects solar energy potential because areas that are closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow the position of the sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator.

"Beginning his second effort that fall, West would invest two million dollars and take over a year to craft his second album. West was significantly inspired by Roseland NYC Live, a 1998 live album by English trip hop group Portishead, produced with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip-hop production.

"West's life took a different direction when his mother, Donda West, died of complications from cosmetic surgery involving abdominoplasty and breast reduction in November 2007. Months later, West and fiancée Alexis Phifer ended their engagement and their long-term intermittent relationship, which had begun in 2002. The events profoundly affected West, who set off for his 2008 Glow in the Dark Tour shortly thereafter. Purportedly because his emotions could not be conveyed through rapping, West decided to sing using the voice audio processor Auto-Tune, which would become a central part of his next effort.

"West's musical career has been defined by frequent stylistic shifts, and has seen him develop and explore a variety of different musical approaches and genres throughout his work. When asked about his musical inspirations, he has named A Tribe Called Quest, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, George Michael, LL Cool J, Phil Collins and Madonna as early interests. He has further described musician David Bowie as one of his 'most important inspirations,' and named producer Puff Daddy as the 'most important cultural figure in my life.' Early in his career, West pioneered a style of production dubbed 'chipmunk soul' which utilized pitched-up vocal samples, usually from soul and R&B songs, along with his own drums and instrumentation. His first major release featuring his trademark soulful vocal sampling style was 'This Can't Be Life', a track from Jay-Z’s The Dynasty: Roc La Familia. West has said that Wu-Tang Clan producer RZA influenced him in his style, and has named Wu-Tang rappers Ghostface Killah and Ol' Dirty Bastard as inspirations. RZA spoke positively of the comparisons, stating in an interview for Rolling Stone, 'All good. I got super respect for Kanye [...] [he] is going to inspire people to be like him.'

"**The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess** is an action-adventure game focused on combat, exploration, and item collection. It uses the basic control scheme introduced in **Ocarina of Time**, including context-sensitive action buttons and **L-targeting (Z-targeting on the Wii)**, a system that allows the player to keep Link's view focused on an enemy or important object while moving and attacking. Link can walk, run, and attack, and will automatically jump when running off of or reaching for a ledge. Link uses a sword and shield in combat, complemented with secondary weapons and items, including a bow and arrows, a boomerang, bombs, and the **Clawshot** (similar to the Hookshot introduced earlier in the The Legend of Zelda series). While L-targeting, projectile-based weapons can be fired at a target without the need for manual aiming.",6,"What is the Clawshot in 'Twilight Princess' similar to, according to the passage?",The Boomerang,The Hookshot,The Sword,The Shield,2,"**እቲ ኣፈ ታሪኽ ካብ :Zelda Twilight **ልእልቲ እዩ ሓደ -action-adventure ጸወታ focused አብ ልዕሊ ,combat ,exploration እና ኣቕሓ .ጥርኑፍ እቲ ነገር uses እቲ መሰረታዊ ምቁጽጻር scheme introduced አብ ውሽጢ **Ocarina ካብ **,ግዜ ይሓውስ -context-sensitive ተግባር buttons እና **-L-targeting (-Z-targeting አብ ልዕሊ እቲ )**,Wii ሓደ ስርዓት እቲ allows እቲ player ናብ ኣፅንሕ 'Link's ኣረኣእያ focused አብ ልዕሊ ሓደ ጸላኢ ወይ ጠቃሚ ግኡዝ ነገር እስካብ moving እና .attacking ሊንክ ይኽእል ,ተእጓዓዝ ,ጉየ እና ,መጥቃዕቲ እና ንመፃእ automatically ምዝላል መዓዝ ምጉያይ ምጥፋእ ካብ ወይ reaching ን ሓደ .ledge ሊንክ uses ሓደ ሴፍ እና ዋልታ አብ ውሽጢ ,combat complemented ምስ secondary weapons እና ,ኣቕሑ ይሓውስ ሓደ ኢድ ምንሳእ እና ,arrows ሓደ ,boomerang ,bombs እና እቲ ****Clawshot (ተመሳሳሊ ናብ እቲ Hookshot introduced ኣቕድም ኣቢሉ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ እቲ ኣፈ ታሪኽ ካብ Zelda ).ተኸታታሊ እስካብ -,L-targeting -projectile-based weapons ይኽእል ኩን fired ኣብ ሓደ ዒላማ ብዘይካ እቲ ድሌት ን ናይ ኢድ .aiming","እንታይ እዩ እቲ Clawshot አብ ውሽጢ 'Twilight 'ልእልቲ ተመሳሳሊ ,ናብ ከም ናብ እቲ ?መሕለፊ",እቲ Boomerang,እቲ Hookshot,እቲ ሴፍ,እቲ ዋልታ
"Twilight Princess takes place several centuries after Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, and begins with a youth named Link who is working as a ranch hand in Ordon Village. One day, the village is attacked by Bulblins, who carry off the village's children with Link in pursuit before he encounters a wall of Twilight. A Shadow Beast pulls him beyond the wall into the Realm of Twilight, where he is transformed into a wolf and imprisoned. Link is soon freed by an imp-like Twilight being named Midna, who dislikes Link but agrees to help him if he obeys her unconditionally. She guides him to Princess Zelda. Zelda explains that Zant, the King of the Twilight, has stolen the light from three of the four Light Spirits and conquered Hyrule.

"Twilight Princess takes place several centuries after Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, and begins with a youth named Link who is working as a ranch hand in Ordon Village. One day, the village is attacked by Bulblins, who carry off the village's children with Link in pursuit before he encounters a wall of Twilight. A Shadow Beast pulls him beyond the wall into the Realm of Twilight, where he is transformed into a wolf and imprisoned. Link is soon freed by an imp-like Twilight being named Midna, who dislikes Link but agrees to help him if he obeys her unconditionally. She guides him to Princess Zelda. Zelda explains that Zant, the King of the Twilight, has stolen the light from three of the four Light Spirits and conquered Hyrule. In order to save Hyrule, Link must first restore the Light Spirits by entering the Twilight-covered areas and, as a wolf, recover the Spirits' lost light. He must do this by collecting the multiple 'Tears of Light'; once all the Tears of Light are collected for one area, he restores that area's Light Spirit.

"Herds of red and fallow deer also roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer, which can frequently be seen in herds to the north of the Forest.

In modern terms, if J is the total angular momentum of a system with rotational invariance, and Jz the angular momentum measured along any given direction, these quantities can only take on the values",3,What was Bohr's initial but incorrect assumption about electron angular momentum?,That it was zero,That it equaled the reduced Planck constant for each electron,That it was infinite,That it was quantized by voltage,2,"Bohr እውን introduced እቲ መጠን , ሕዚ ፍሉጥ ከም እቲ reduced Planck ,ቀዋሚ ከም እቲ quantum ካብ angular .momentum ኣብ ,መጀመርታ Bohr ሓሳብ እቲ እዚ ኔሩ እቲ angular momentum ካብ ሕድሕድ electron አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ :atom እዚ proved incorrect ,እና ብዘየገድስ developments ብ Sommerfeld እና ,others ሓደ ትኽክለኛ መግለፂ ካብ እቲ electron angular momentum proved ብልዕሊ እቲ Bohr .መርኣያ እቲ ልክዕ quantization ስርዓታት ን electrons – አብ ውሽጢ አየናይ እቲ ጉልበት reduces ናብ እቲ Bohr መርኣያ equation አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ጉዳይ ካብ እቲ hydrogen atom – ኔሮም ዝተወሃበ ብ 'Heisenberg's matrix mechanics አብ ውሽጢ 1925 እና እቲ Schrödinger ማዕበል equation አብ ውሽጢ :1926 እቲ reduced Planck ቀዋሚ remains እቲ መሰረታዊ quantum ካብ angular .momentum አብ ውሽጢ ዘበናዊ ,ስያመታት እንተ J እዩ እቲ ድምር angular momentum ካብ ሓደ ስርዓት ምስ rotational ,invariance እና Jz እቲ angular momentum measured ማዕረ ኣንፈት ዝኾነ ዝተወሃበ ,ኣንፈት እዚ quantities ይኽእል ጥራሕ ውሰድ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ values",እንታይ ኔሩ 'Bohr's መጀመሪ ግን incorrect ግምት ብዝዕባ electron angular ?momentum,እቲ እቲ ነገር ኔሩ ባዶ,እቲ እቲ ነገር equaled እቲ reduced Planck ቀዋሚ ን ሕድሕድ electron,እቲ እቲ ነገር ኔሩ infinite,እቲ እቲ ነገር ኔሩ quantized ብ voltage
"A new device for granting assent was created during the reign of King Henry VIII.

"Hellenistic warfare was a continuation of the military developments of Iphicrates and Philip II of Macedon, particularly his use of the Macedonian Phalanx, a dense formation of pikemen, in conjunction with heavy companion cavalry. Armies of the Hellenistic period differed from those of the classical period in being largely made up of professional soldiers and also in their greater specialization and technical proficiency in siege warfare. Hellenistic armies were significantly larger than those of classical Greece relying increasingly on Greek mercenaries (misthophoroi; men-for-pay) and also on non-Greek soldiery such as Thracians, Galatians, Egyptians and Iranians. Some ethnic groups were known for their martial skill in a particular mode of combat and were highly sought after, including Tarantine cavalry, Cretan archers, Rhodian slingers and Thracian peltasts. This period also saw the adoption of new weapons and troop types such as Thureophoroi and the Thorakitai who used the oval Thureos shield and fought with javelins and the machaira sword. The use of heavily armored cataphracts and also horse archers was adopted by the Seleucids, Greco-Bactrians, Armenians and Pontus. The use of war elephants also became common.

"In a response to Livingstone, Theodore Dobzhansky argued that when talking about race one must be attentive to how the term is being used: 'I agree with Dr. Livingstone that if races have to be “discrete units,” then there are no races, and if “race” is used as an “explanation” of the human variability, rather than vice versa, then the explanation is invalid.' He further argued that one could use the term race if one distinguished between 'race differences' and 'the race concept.' The former refers to any distinction in gene frequencies between populations; the latter is 'a matter of judgment.' He further observed that even when there is clinal variation, 'Race differences are objectively ascertainable biological phenomena… but it does not follow that racially distinct populations must be given racial (or subspecific) labels.' In short, Livingstone and Dobzhansky agree that there are genetic differences among human beings; they also agree that the use of the race concept to classify people, and how the race concept is used, is a matter of social convention.

"Muslim scientists contributed to advances in the sciences. They placed far greater emphasis on experiment than had the Greeks.

The most important development of the scientific method was the use of experiments to distinguish between competing scientific theories set within a generally empirical orientation, which began among Muslim scientists.

"The storage in sensory memory and short-term memory generally has a strictly limited capacity and duration, which means that information is not retained indefinitely. By contrast, long-term memory can store much larger quantities of information for potentially unlimited duration (sometimes a whole life span). Its capacity is immeasurable. For example, given a random seven-digit number we may remember it for only a few seconds before forgetting, suggesting it was stored in our short-term memory. On the other hand, we can remember telephone numbers for many years through repetition; this information is said to be stored in long-term memory.",1,What is the main difference between short-term memory and long-term memory as described in the passage?,"Short-term memory has limited capacity and duration, while long-term memory stores vast amounts of information for possibly a lifetime",Both have unlimited capacity,"Long-term memory fades quickly, while short-term memory is permanent",There is no difference,1,"እቲ መኽዚን አብ ውሽጢ sensory ተዘክሮ እና -short-term ተዘክሮ ብሓፈሻ ኣለዎ ሓደ strictly limited ትኽእሎ እና ,ጻንሒት አየናይ ማለት እቲ ሓበሬታ እዩ ዘይኮነ retained .indefinitely ብ ,ኣወዳደረ -long-term ተዘክሮ ይኽእል መኽዝን ብዙሕ larger quantities ካብ ሓበሬታ ን potentially unlimited ጻንሒት (ሓደ ሓደ ግዘ ሓደ ሙሉእ ህይወት ).ንውሓቱ ናቱ ትኽእሎ እዩ .immeasurable ን ,ኣብነት ዝተወሃበ ሓደ ሓንደበት -seven-digit ቑጽሪ ንሕና ተዝኸዉን ዘክር እቲ ነገር ን ጥራሕ ሓደ ቁሩብ seconds ቅድሚ ,forgetting suggesting እቲ ነገር ኔሩ stored አብ ውሽጢ ናትና -short-term .ተዘክሮ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ካልእ ,ኢድ ንሕና ይኽእል ዘክር telephone numbers ን ቡዙሕ ዓመታት ብውሽጢ ;repetition እዚ ሓበሬታ እዩ ኢሉ ናብ ኩን stored አብ ውሽጢ -long-term .ተዘክሮ",እንታይ እዩ እቲ ዋና ኣፈላላይ አብ መንጎ -short-term ተዘክሮ እና -long-term ተዘክሮ ከም described አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ?መሕለፊ,"-Short-term ተዘክሮ ኣለዎ limited ትኽእሎ እና ,ጻንሒት እስካብ -long-term ተዘክሮ stores ሰፊሕ amounts ካብ ሓበሬታ ን possibly ሓደ lifetime",ክልቲኡ ኣለኒ unlimited ትኽእሎ,"-Long-term ተዘክሮ fades ,ብህጹጽ እስካብ -short-term ተዘክሮ እዩ ቀዋሚ",ኣብቲ እዩ አይኮንን ኣፈላላይ

Boards may be single-sided, with an unplated component side, or more compact double-sided boards, with components soldered on both sides. Horizontal installation of through-hole parts with two axial leads (such as resistors, capacitors, and diodes) is done by bending the leads 90 degrees in the same direction, inserting the part in the board (often bending leads located on the back of the board in opposite directions to improve the part's mechanical strength), soldering the leads, and trimming off the ends.
