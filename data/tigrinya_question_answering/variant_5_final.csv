"Roncalli was elected pope on 28 October 1958 at age 76 after 11 ballots. His selection was unexpected, and Roncalli himself had come to Rome with a return train ticket to Venice. He was the first pope to take the pontifical name of ""John"" upon election in more than 500 years, and his choice settled the complicated question of official numbering attached to this papal name due to the antipope of this name. Pope John XXIII surprised those who expected him to be a caretaker pope by calling the historic Second Vatican Council (1962–65), the first session opening on 11 October 1962. His passionate views on equality were summed up in his famous statement, ""We were all made in God's image, and thus, we are all Godly alike."" John XXIII made many passionate speeches during his pontificate, one of which was on the day that he opened the Second Vatican Council in the middle of the night to the crowd gathered in St. Peter's Square: ""Dear children, returning home, you will find children: give your children a hug and say: This is a hug from the Pope!""",3,Who was elected pope on 28 October 1958?,28 October 1958,more than 500 years,Roncalli,11,3,"Roncalli ኔሩ elected pope አብ ልዕሊ 28 ጥቅምቲ 1958 ኣብ ዕድመ 76 ድሕሪ 11 .ballots ናቱ selection ኔሩ ,unexpected እና Roncalli himself ዝነበረ ንዓ ናብ Rome ምስ ሓደ ተመለስ ባቡር ticket ናብ .Venice ንሱ ኔሩ እቲ መጀመርታ pope ናብ ውሰድ እቲ pontifical ሽም ካብ """"John ኣብ ግዘ election አብ ውሽጢ ቡዙሕ ካብ 500 ,ዓመታት እና ናቱ ምርጫ settled እቲ ውስብስብ ሕቶ ካብ ዘፍለጠ numbering ጥባቕ ናብ እዚ papal ሽም መወዳእታ ናብ እቲ antipope ካብ እዚ .ሽም Pope John XXIII ዝተገረመ እቲኦም መን ዝፅበ ንሱ ናብ ኩን ሓደ caretaker pope ብ calling እቲ historic ካልኣይ Vatican ዋዕላ (),1962–65 እቲ መጀመርታ ፕሮግራም opening አብ ልዕሊ 11 ጥቅምቲ .1962 ናቱ ስምዒታዊ views አብ ልዕሊ equality ኔሮም summed ሓፍ አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ ተፈላጢ ,ዓንቀፅ ""ንሕና ኔሮም ኩሎም ዝተሰርሐ አብ ውሽጢ 'God's ,ስእሊ እና ,ስለዝኾነ ንሕና እዮም ኩሎም Godly .""alike John XXIII ዝተሰርሐ ቡዙሕ ስምዒታዊ speeches አብ እዋን ናቱ ,pontificate ሓደ ካብ አየናይ ኔሩ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ መዓልቲ እቲ ንሱ opened እቲ ካልኣይ Vatican ዋዕላ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ማእኸል ካብ እቲ ምሸት ናብ እቲ ጭንቕንቕ gathered አብ ውሽጢ .ቅዱስ 'Peter's :ርባዕ ""ፍትውቲ ,ቖልዑ returning ,ገዛ ንስኻ ንመፃእ ርኸብ :ቖልዑ ሃብ ናትካ ቖልዑ ሓደ ምሕቋፍ እና :በል እዚ እዩ ሓደ ምሕቋፍ ካብ እቲ !""Pope",መን ኔሩ elected pope አብ ልዕሊ 28 ጥቅምቲ ?1958,28 ጥቅምቲ 1958,ቡዙሕ ካብ 500 ዓመታት,Roncalli,11
"Most of the Low Countries had come under the rule of the House of Burgundy and subsequently the House of Habsburg.

"By the 1890s the profound effect of adrenal extracts on many different tissue types had been discovered, setting off a search both for the mechanism of chemical signalling and efforts to exploit these observations for the development of new drugs. The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897 John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis. Parke Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name Adrenalin. Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist). By 1929 epinephrine had been formulated into an inhaler for use in the treatment of nasal congestion.",9,When was the profound effect of adrenal extracts discovered?,Johns Hopkins University,Adrenalin,Primatene Mist,the 1890s,4,"ብ እቲ 1890s እቲ ዓሚቚ ፅልዋ ካብ adrenal extracts አብ ልዕሊ ቡዙሕ ፍሉይ ቲሹ types ዝነበረ ዝነበረ ,discovered ምምላእ ምጥፋእ ሓደ ምድላይ ክልቲኡ ን እቲ mechanism ካብ chemical signalling እና efforts ናብ ኣማዕበለ እዚ observations ን እቲ ዕብየት ካብ ሓድሽ .drugs እቲ ደም ፀቅጢ raising እና vasoconstrictive effects ካብ adrenal extracts ኔሮም ካብ ብፍሉይ ወለድ ናብ surgeons ከም hemostatic agents እና ከም ህክምና ን ,shock እና ሓደ ቑጽሪ ካብ companies ምዕቡል products መሰረት ዝገበረ አብ ልዕሊ adrenal extracts containing varying purities ካብ እቲ ንቑሕ .ዓውደ ኣካል አብ ውሽጢ 1897 John Abel ካብ Johns Hopkins ዩኒቨርሲቲ identified እቲ ንቑሕ principle ከም ,epinephrine አየናይ ንሱ ዝተገለለ አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ impure ግዝኣት ከም እቲ sulfate .ጨው Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine ዳሕራይ ምዕቡል ሓደ ሜላ ን obtaining epinephrine አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ፅሩይ ,ግዝኣት እና licensed እቲ ቴክኖሎጂ ናብ Parke .Davis Parke Davis marketed epinephrine ትሕቲ እቲ ንግዲ ሽም .Adrenalin Injected epinephrine proved ናብ ኩን ብፍላይ efficacious ን እቲ ኣፀጋሚ ህክምና ካብ asthma ,attacks እና ሓደ inhaled ሕታም ኔሩ ሽዩጥ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ United States ክሳብ 2011 (Primatene ).ግመ ብ 1929 epinephrine ዝነበረ ዝነበረ formulated ናብ ውሽጢ ሓደ inhaler ን ጥቅሚ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ህክምና ካብ nasal .congestion",መዓዝ ኔሩ እቲ ዓሚቚ ፅልዋ ካብ adrenal extracts ?discovered,Johns Hopkins ዩኒቨርሲቲ,Adrenalin,Primatene ግመ,እቲ 1890s

"The most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus, bacteria, or parasite; a condition known as gastroenteritis. These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by stool, or directly from another person who is infected. It may be divided into three types: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and if it lasts for more than two weeks, persistent diarrhea. The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present it is also known as dysentery.

"The exact nature of relations between Tibet and the Ming dynasty of China (1368–1644) is unclear. Analysis of the relationship is further complicated by modern political conflicts and the application of Westphalian sovereignty to a time when the concept did not exist. Some Mainland Chinese scholars, such as Wang Jiawei and Nyima Gyaincain, assert that the Ming dynasty had unquestioned sovereignty over Tibet, pointing to the Ming court's issuing of various titles to Tibetan leaders, Tibetans' full acceptance of these titles, and a renewal process for successors of these titles that involved traveling to the Ming capital. Scholars within China also argue that Tibet has been an integral part of China since the 13th century and that it was thus a part of the Ming Empire. But most scholars outside China, such as Turrell V. Wylie, Melvin C. Goldstein, and Helmut Hoffman, say that the relationship was one of suzerainty, that Ming titles were only nominal, that Tibet remained an independent region outside Ming control, and that it simply paid tribute until the Jiajing Emperor (1521–1566), who ceased relations with Tibet.",15,When was the exact nature of relations between Tibet and the Ming dynasty of China unclear?,1368–1644,Nyima Gyaincain,Melvin C.

"Puberty occurs through a long process and begins with a surge in hormone production, which in turn causes a number of physical changes. It is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics (for example, a deeper voice and larger adam's apple in boys, and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the pituitary gland, which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction to occur. The male and female gonads are subsequently activated, which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals. The testes primarily release testosterone, and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen. The production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met.

In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer.

"The most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus, bacteria, or parasite; a condition known as gastroenteritis. These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by stool, or directly from another person who is infected. It may be divided into three types: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and if it lasts for more than two weeks, persistent diarrhea. The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present it is also known as dysentery. A number of non-infectious causes may also result in diarrhea, including hyperthyroidism, lactose intolerance, inflammatory bowel disease, a number of medications, and irritable bowel syndrome.

"Roncalli was elected pope on 28 October 1958 at age 76 after 11 ballots. His selection was unexpected, and Roncalli himself had come to Rome with a return train ticket to Venice. He was the first pope to take the pontifical name of ""John"" upon election in more than 500 years, and his choice settled the complicated question of official numbering attached to this papal name due to the antipope of this name. Pope John XXIII surprised those who expected him to be a caretaker pope by calling the historic Second Vatican Council (1962–65), the first session opening on 11 October 1962. His passionate views on equality were summed up in his famous statement, ""We were all made in God's image, and thus, we are all Godly alike."" John XXIII made many passionate speeches during his pontificate, one of which was on the day that he opened the Second Vatican Council in the middle of the night to the crowd gathered in St. Peter's Square: ""Dear children, returning home, you will find children: give your children a hug and say: This is a hug from the Pope!""",30,Who was the first pope to take the pontifical name of John after 500 years?,11,Roncalli,more than 500 years,28 October 1958,2,"Roncalli ኔሩ elected pope አብ ልዕሊ 28 ጥቅምቲ 1958 ኣብ ዕድመ 76 ድሕሪ 11 .ballots ናቱ selection ኔሩ ,unexpected እና Roncalli himself ዝነበረ ንዓ ናብ Rome ምስ ሓደ ተመለስ ባቡር ticket ናብ .Venice ንሱ ኔሩ እቲ መጀመርታ pope ናብ ውሰድ እቲ pontifical ሽም ካብ """"John ኣብ ግዘ election አብ ውሽጢ ቡዙሕ ካብ 500 ,ዓመታት እና ናቱ ምርጫ settled እቲ ውስብስብ ሕቶ ካብ ዘፍለጠ numbering ጥባቕ ናብ እዚ papal ሽም መወዳእታ ናብ እቲ antipope ካብ እዚ .ሽም Pope John XXIII ዝተገረመ እቲኦም መን ዝፅበ ንሱ ናብ ኩን ሓደ caretaker pope ብ calling እቲ historic ካልኣይ Vatican ዋዕላ (),1962–65 እቲ መጀመርታ ፕሮግራም opening አብ ልዕሊ 11 ጥቅምቲ .1962 ናቱ ስምዒታዊ views አብ ልዕሊ equality ኔሮም summed ሓፍ አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ ተፈላጢ ,ዓንቀፅ ""ንሕና ኔሮም ኩሎም ዝተሰርሐ አብ ውሽጢ 'God's ,ስእሊ እና ,ስለዝኾነ ንሕና እዮም ኩሎም Godly .""alike John XXIII ዝተሰርሐ ቡዙሕ ስምዒታዊ speeches አብ እዋን ናቱ ,pontificate ሓደ ካብ አየናይ ኔሩ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ መዓልቲ እቲ ንሱ opened እቲ ካልኣይ Vatican ዋዕላ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ማእኸል ካብ እቲ ምሸት ናብ እቲ ጭንቕንቕ gathered አብ ውሽጢ .ቅዱስ 'Peter's :ርባዕ ""ፍትውቲ ,ቖልዑ returning ,ገዛ ንስኻ ንመፃእ ርኸብ :ቖልዑ ሃብ ናትካ ቖልዑ ሓደ ምሕቋፍ እና :በል እዚ እዩ ሓደ ምሕቋፍ ካብ እቲ !""Pope",መን ኔሩ እቲ መጀመርታ pope ናብ ውሰድ እቲ pontifical ሽም ካብ John ድሕሪ 500 ?ዓመታት,11,Roncalli,ቡዙሕ ካብ 500 ዓመታት,28 ጥቅምቲ 1958
"In philosophy, idealism is the group of philosophies which assert that reality, or reality as we can know it, is fundamentally mental, mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial. Epistemologically, idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In a sociological sense, idealism emphasizes how human ideas—especially beliefs and values—shape society. As an ontological doctrine, idealism goes further, asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit. Idealism thus rejects physicalist and dualist theories that fail to ascribe priority to the mind.",31,How does idealism feel about the existence of any mind-independent thing?,—,—,—,a skepticism,4,"አብ ውሽጢ ,ፍልስፍና idealism እዩ እቲ ጉጅለ ካብ philosophies አየናይ assert እቲ ,ክውንነት ወይ ክውንነት ከም ንሕና ይኽእል ፍለጥ ,እቲ ነገር እዩ fundamentally ,ስነ ኣእምሮኣዊ mentally ,constructed ወይ ተዘይኮይኑ ግን .immaterial ,Epistemologically idealism manifests ከም ሓደ skepticism ብዝዕባ እቲ possibility ካብ knowing ዝኾነ -mind-independent .ነገር አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ sociological ,ትርጉም idealism emphasizes ከመይ ሰብ ideas—especially beliefs እና values—shape .ሕብረተሰብ ከም ሓደ ontological ,doctrine idealism ይኸድ ,ርሑቅ asserting እቲ ኩሎም entities እዮም composed ካብ ሓንጎል ወይ .መንፈስ Idealism ስለዝኾነ rejects physicalist እና dualist theories እቲ ምውዳቕ ናብ ascribe ቀዳምነት ናብ እቲ .ሓንጎል",ከመይ ምግባር idealism ምስማዕ ብዝዕባ እቲ ህላወ ካብ ዝኾነ -mind-independent ?ነገር,—,—,—,ሓደ skepticism
"A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions. Sometimes the status of great powers is formally recognized in conferences such as the Congress of Vienna or an international structure such as the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States serve as the body's five permanent members). At the same time the status of great powers can be informally recognized in a forum such as the G7 which consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.",32,What is a sovereign state known as with the ability to exert its influence on a global scale?,Italy,A great power,G7,five,2,"ሓደ ምዑዝ ሓይሊ እዩ ሓደ sovereign ግዝኣት እቲ እዩ recognized ከም ምህላው እቲ ተኽእሎ እና expertise ናብ exert ናቱ ተፅዕኖ አብ ልዕሊ ሓደ ዓለምለኻዊ .መለክዒ ምዑዝ powers characteristically ጥሪት ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት እና ቁጠባዊ ,ጥንካረ ከም ደሓን ከም diplomatic እና ልስሉስ ሓይሊ ,ተፅዕኖ አየናይ ተዝኸዉን ጠንቂ ማእኸል ወይ ንኡስ powers ናብ ሕሰበሉ እቲ ምዑዝ 'powers opinions ቅድሚ taking actions ካብ ናቶም .ወንን ዓለም ለኻዊ relations theorists ኣለኒ posited እቲ ምዑዝ ሓይሊ ኩነታት ይኽእል ኩን characterized ናብ ውሽጢ ሓይሊ ,capabilities spatial ,aspects እና ኩነታት .dimensions ሓደ ሓደ ግዘ እቲ ኩነታት ካብ ምዑዝ powers እዩ formally recognized አብ ውሽጢ conferences ከምዚ ከም እቲ Congress ካብ Vienna ወይ ሓደ ዓለም ለኻዊ ቅርፂ ከምዚ ከም እቲ United Nations ድሕንነት ዋዕላ (,China ,France ,Russia እቲ United Kingdom እና እቲ United States ኣገልገለ ከም እቲ 'body's ሓሙሽተ ቀዋሚ ).members ኣብ እቲ ማዕረ ግዜ እቲ ኩነታት ካብ ምዑዝ powers ይኽእል ኩን informally recognized አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ forum ከምዚ ከም እቲ G7 አየናይ consists ካብ ,Canada ,France ,Germany ,Italy ,Japan እቲ United Kingdom እና እቲ United States ካብ .America",እንታይ እዩ ሓደ sovereign ግዝኣት ፍሉጥ ከም ምስ እቲ ተኽእሎ ናብ exert ናቱ ተፅዕኖ አብ ልዕሊ ሓደ ዓለምለኻዊ ?መለክዒ,Italy,ሓደ ምዑዝ ሓይሊ,G7,ሓሙሽተ
"Schwarzenegger began weight training at the age of 15. He won the Mr. Universe title at age 20 and went on to win the Mr. Olympia contest seven times. Schwarzenegger has remained a prominent presence in bodybuilding and has written many books and articles on the sport. He is widely considered to be among the greatest bodybuilders of all times as well as its biggest icon. Schwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action film icon. His breakthrough film was the sword-and-sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian in 1982, which was a box-office hit and resulted in a sequel. In 1984, he appeared in James Cameron's science-fiction thriller film The Terminator, which was a massive critical and box-office success. Schwarzenegger subsequently reprised the Terminator character in the franchise's later installments in 1991, 2003, and 2015. He appeared in a number of successful films, such as Commando (1985), The Running Man (1987), Predator (1987), Twins (1988), Total Recall (1990), Kindergarten Cop (1990) and True Lies (1994). He was nicknamed the ""Austrian Oak"" in his bodybuilding days, ""Arnie"" during his acting career, and ""The Governator"" (a portmanteau of ""Governor"" and ""The Terminator"", one of his best-known movie roles).",33,How many times did Schwarzenegger win the Mr. Olympia title?,The Running Man (,seven,Commando,Conan,2,"Schwarzenegger ጀሚሩ ክብደት ስልጠና ኣብ እቲ ዕድመ ካብ .15 ንሱ ተዓወተ እቲ .Mr Universe ርእሲ ኣብ ዕድመ 20 እና ኬዱ አብ ልዕሊ ናብ ዓወት እቲ .Mr Olympia ውድድር ሸውዓተ .times Schwarzenegger ኣለዎ remained ሓደ ጠቃሚ ህላወ አብ ውሽጢ bodybuilding እና ኣለዎ ዝተፀሓፈ ቡዙሕ books እና articles አብ ልዕሊ እቲ .sport ንሱ እዩ widely ገምገመ ናብ ኩን ካብዞም እቲ greatest bodybuilders ካብ ኩሎም times ከም ደሓን ከም ናቱ biggest .icon Schwarzenegger gained worldwide ፍሉጥ ከም ሓደ Hollywood ተግባር ፊልሚ .icon ናቱ breakthrough ፊልሚ ኔሩ እቲ --sword-and-sorcery ደስ በሃሊ Conan እቲ Barbarian አብ ውሽጢ ,1982 አየናይ ኔሩ ሓደ -box-office በሎ እና resulted አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ .sequel አብ ውሽጢ ,1984 ንሱ ወፀ አብ ውሽጢ James 'Cameron's -science-fiction thriller ፊልሚ እቲ ,Terminator አየናይ ኔሩ ሓደ ዓብዪ ወሳኒ እና -box-office .ዓወት Schwarzenegger subsequently reprised እቲ Terminator መልክዕ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 'franchise's ዳሕራይ installments አብ ውሽጢ ,1991 ,2003 እና .2015 ንሱ ወፀ አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ቑጽሪ ካብ ዕውት ,films ከምዚ ከም Commando (),1985 እቲ ምጉያይ ሰብኣይ (),1987 Predator (),1987 Twins (),1988 ድምር ምዝካር (),1990 Kindergarten Cop ()1990 እና ሓቂ ኣደቓቕሳ ().1994 ንሱ ኔሩ nicknamed እቲ ""Austrian ""Oak አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ bodybuilding ,days """"Arnie አብ እዋን ናቱ acting ,ሞያ እና ""እቲ ""Governator (ሓደ portmanteau ካብ """"Governor እና ""እቲ "",Terminator ሓደ ካብ ናቱ -best-known ፊልሚ ).roles",ከመይ ቡዙሕ times ግቡር Schwarzenegger ዓወት እቲ .Mr Olympia ?ርእሲ,እቲ ምጉያይ ሰብኣይ (,ሸውዓተ,Commando,Conan
"In monotheism and henotheism, God is conceived of as the Supreme Being and principal object of faith. The concept of God as described by theologians commonly includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), omnibenevolence (perfect goodness), divine simplicity, and eternal and necessary existence. God is also usually defined as a non-corporeal being without any human biological gender, but the concept of God actively (as opposed to receptively) creating the universe has caused some religions to give ""Him"" the metaphorical name of ""Father"". Because God is conceived as not being a corporeal being, God cannot(some say should not) be portrayed in a literal visual image; some religious groups use a man (sometimes old and bearded) to symbolize God because of His deed of creating man's mind in the image of His own.",34,What is God conceived of as in monotheism and henotheism?,the Supreme Being,—,—,—,1,"አብ ውሽጢ monotheism እና ,henotheism ፈጣሪ እዩ conceived ካብ ከም እቲ Supreme ፍጥረት እና ርእሰ መምህር ግኡዝ ነገር ካብ .እምነት እቲ ጭብጢ ካብ ፈጣሪ ከም described ብ theologians commonly includes እቲ attributes ካብ omniscience (infinite ),ፍልጠት omnipotence (unlimited ),ሓይሊ omnipresence (እዋናዊ ),everywhere omnibenevolence (ፍፁም ),goodness መለኮታዊ ,simplicity እና ቀፃሊ እና አድላዩ .ህላወ ፈጣሪ እዩ እውን ብልሙድ defined ከም ሓደ -non-corporeal ፍጥረት ብዘይካ ዝኾነ ሰብ biological ,ፆታ ግን እቲ ጭብጢ ካብ ፈጣሪ actively (ከም opposed ናብ )receptively creating እቲ universe ኣለዎ caused ንእሽተይ religions ናብ ሃብ """"ንሱ እቲ metaphorical ሽም ካብ """".ኣቦ ምኽንያቱ ፈጣሪ እዩ conceived ከም ዘይኮነ ፍጥረት ሓደ corporeal ,ፍጥረት ፈጣሪ (cannot(some በል ይሓይሽ )ዘይኮነ ኩን portrayed አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ literal ምስላዊ ;ስእሊ ንእሽተይ ሃይማኖታዊ groups ጥቅሚ ሓደ ሰብኣይ (ሓደ ሓደ ግዘ ዓብይ እና )bearded ናብ symbolize ፈጣሪ ምኽንያቱ ካብ ናቱ ሓቂ ካብ creating 'man's ሓንጎል አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ስእሊ ካብ ናቱ .ወንን",እንታይ እዩ ፈጣሪ conceived ካብ ከም አብ ውሽጢ monotheism እና ?henotheism,እቲ Supreme ፍጥረት,—,—,—

"The phonograph disc record was the primary medium used for music reproduction until late in the 20th century, replacing the phonograph cylinder record–with which it had co-existed from the late 1880s through to the 1920s–by the late 1920s. Records retained the largest market share even when new formats such as compact cassette were mass-marketed. By the late 1980s, digital media, in the form of the compact disc, had gained a larger market share, and the vinyl record left the mainstream in 1991. From the 1990s to the 2010s, records continued to be manufactured and sold on a much smaller scale, and were especially used by disc jockeys (DJ)s, released by artists in some genres, and listened to by a niche market of audiophiles. The phonograph record has made a niche resurgence in the early 21st century – 9.2 million records were sold in the U.S. in 2014, a 260% increase since 2009.

"Roman government was headed by two consuls, elected annually by the citizens and advised by a senate composed of appointed magistrates. As Roman society was very hierarchical by modern standards, the evolution of the Roman government was heavily influenced by the struggle between the patricians, Rome's land-holding aristocracy, who traced their ancestry to the founding of Rome, and the plebeians, the far more numerous citizen-commoners. Over time, the laws that gave patricians exclusive rights to Rome's highest offices were repealed or weakened, and leading plebeian families became full members of the aristocracy. The leaders of the Republic developed a strong tradition and morality requiring public service and patronage in peace and war, making military and political success inextricably linked.

"Nonverbal communication describes the process of conveying meaning in the form of non-word messages. Examples of nonverbal communication include haptic communication, chronemic communication, gestures, body language, facial expression, eye contact, and how one dresses. Nonverbal communication also relates to intent of a message. Examples of intent are voluntary, intentional movements like shaking a hand or winking, as well as involuntary, such as sweating. Speech also contains nonverbal elements known as paralanguage, e.g. rhythm, intonation, tempo, and stress. There may even be a pheromone component. Research has shown that up to 55% of human communication may occur through non-verbal facial expressions, and a further 38% through paralanguage. It affects communication most at the subconscious level and establishes trust. Likewise, written texts include nonverbal elements such as handwriting style, spatial arrangement of words and the use of emoticons to convey emotion.",44,What type of communication describes the process of conveying meaning in the form of non-word messages?,up to 55%,38%,Nonverbal,one,3,"Nonverbal ሓሳብ ንሓሳብ ምልውዋጥ describes እቲ ከይዲ ካብ conveying ትርጉም አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ፎርም ካብ -non-word .messages Examples ካብ nonverbal ሓሳብ ንሓሳብ ምልውዋጥ ይሓውስ haptic ,ሓሳብ ንሓሳብ ምልውዋጥ chronemic ,ሓሳብ ንሓሳብ ምልውዋጥ ,gestures ሰውነት ,ቋንቋ facial ,ኣገላልፃ ዓይኒ ,መርከቢ እና ከመይ ሓደ .dresses Nonverbal ሓሳብ ንሓሳብ ምልውዋጥ እውን relates ናብ intent ካብ ሓደ .መልእኽቲ Examples ካብ intent እዮም ,voluntary intentional movements ምፍታው shaking ሓደ ኢድ ወይ ,winking ከም ደሓን ከም ,involuntary ከምዚ ከም .sweating ዘረባ እውን የጠቓልል nonverbal elements ፍሉጥ ከም ,paralanguage ..e.g ,ስኒት ,intonation ,tempo እና .ጭንቀት ኣብቲ ተዝኸዉን ሙሉእ ኩን ሓደ pheromone .component ፅንዓት ኣለዎ shown እቲ ሓፍ ናብ %55 ካብ ሰብ ሓሳብ ንሓሳብ ምልውዋጥ ተዝኸዉን ይፍፀም ብውሽጢ -non-verbal facial ,expressions እና ሓደ ርሑቅ %38 ብውሽጢ .paralanguage እቲ ነገር affects ሓሳብ ንሓሳብ ምልውዋጥ ብጥዕሚ ኣብ እቲ subconscious ብርኪ እና establishes .እምነት ,ከምኡውን ዝተፀሓፈ texts ይሓውስ nonverbal elements ከምዚ ከም handwriting ,ኣገባብ spatial መስርዕ ካብ ቃላት እና እቲ ጥቅሚ ካብ emoticons ናብ ፅዒንካ ውሰድ .emotion",እንታይ ዓይነት ካብ ሓሳብ ንሓሳብ ምልውዋጥ describes እቲ ከይዲ ካብ conveying ትርጉም አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ፎርም ካብ -non-word ?messages,ሓፍ ናብ %55,%38,Nonverbal,ሓደ

"The city was founded in 734 BC by the Phoenicians as Ziz ('flower'). Palermo then became a possession of Carthage, before becoming part of the Roman Republic, the Roman Empire and eventually part of the Byzantine Empire, for over a thousand years. The Greeks named the city Panormus meaning 'complete port'. From 831 to 1072 the city was under Arab rule during the Emirate of Sicily when the city first became a capital. The Arabs shifted the Greek name into Balarm, the root for Palermo's present-day name. Following the Norman reconquest, Palermo became the capital of a new kingdom (from 1130 to 1816), the Kingdom of Sicily and the capital of the Holy Roman Empire under Frederick II Holy Roman Emperor and Conrad IV of Germany, King of the Romans.

"Josip Broz Tito (Cyrillic: Јосип Броз Тито, pronounced [jǒsip brôːz tîto]; born Josip Broz; 7 May 1892[nb 1] – 4 May 1980) was a Yugoslav revolutionary and statesman, serving in various roles from 1943 until his death in 1980. During World War II he was the leader of the Partisans, often regarded as the most effective resistance movement in occupied Europe. While his presidency has been criticized as authoritarian, and concerns about the repression of political opponents have been raised, Tito was ""seen by most as a benevolent dictator"" due to his economic and diplomatic policies. He was a popular public figure both in Yugoslavia and abroad. Viewed as a unifying symbol, his internal policies maintained the peaceful coexistence of the nations of the Yugoslav federation.

"It has been used for thousands of years for both fuel and as a construction material. It is an organic material, a natural composite of cellulose fibers (which are strong in tension) embedded in a matrix of lignin which resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees, or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs.[citation needed] In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves, other growing tissues, and the roots.

"The priesthoods of public religion were held by members of the elite classes. There was no principle analogous to separation of church and state in ancient Rome. During the Roman Republic (509–27 BC), the same men who were elected public officials might also serve as augurs and pontiffs. Priests married, raised families, and led politically active lives. Julius Caesar became pontifex maximus before he was elected consul. The augurs read the will of the gods and supervised the marking of boundaries as a reflection of universal order, thus sanctioning Roman expansionism as a matter of divine destiny. The Roman triumph was at its core a religious procession in which the victorious general displayed his piety and his willingness to serve the public good by dedicating a portion of his spoils to the gods, especially Jupiter, who embodied just rule. As a result of the Punic Wars (264–146 BC), when Rome struggled to establish itself as a dominant power, many new temples were built by magistrates in fulfillment of a vow to a deity for assuring their military success.",65,When did elite members of Rome hold priesthoods?,509–27,Rome,Jupiter,Roman,1,"እቲ priesthoods ካብ ህዝባዊ ሃይማኖት ኔሮም ተገይሩ ብ members ካብ እቲ elite .classes ኣብቲ ኔሩ አይኮንን principle analogous ናብ separation ካብ ቤተ ክርስትያን እና ግዝኣት አብ ውሽጢ ጥንታዊ .Rome አብ እዋን እቲ Roman Republic (509–27 ),BC እቲ ማዕረ men መን ኔሮም elected ህዝባዊ officials ይኸዉን እውን ኣገልገለ ከም augurs እና .pontiffs Priests ,ምርዕው ተሰአ ,families እና መረሐ politically ንቑሕ .ይነብር Julius Caesar ኮይኑ pontifex maximus ቅድሚ ንሱ ኔሩ elected .consul እቲ augurs ኣንብብ እቲ ንመፃእ ካብ እቲ gods እና supervised እቲ marking ካብ ዶባት ከም ሓደ ምስትንታን ካብ universal ,ስርዓት ስለዝኾነ sanctioning Roman expansionism ከም ሓደ ነገር ካብ መለኮታዊ .ዕድል እቲ Roman triumph ኔሩ ኣብ ናቱ ማእኸል ሓደ ሃይማኖታዊ procession አብ ውሽጢ አየናይ እቲ victorious ሓፈሻዊ displayed ናቱ piety እና ናቱ willingness ናብ ኣገልገለ እቲ ህዝባዊ ፅቡቅ ብ dedicating ሓደ portion ካብ ናቱ spoils ናብ እቲ ,gods ብፍላይ ,Jupiter መን embodied ጥራሕ .ስርዓት ከም ሓደ ውፅኢት ካብ እቲ Punic Wars (264–146 ),BC መዓዝ Rome struggled ናብ መስርት itself ከም ሓደ ዓብላሊ ,ሓይሊ ቡዙሕ ሓድሽ temples ኔሮም ተሃኒጹ ብ magistrates አብ ውሽጢ fulfillment ካብ ሓደ vow ናብ ሓደ deity ን assuring ናቶም ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት .ዓወት",መዓዝ ግቡር elite members ካብ Rome ሓዝ ?priesthoods,509–27,Rome,Jupiter,Roman

"Mosaic has a long history, starting in Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium BC. Pebble mosaics were made in Tiryns in Mycenean Greece; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times, both in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. Early Christian basilicas from the 4th century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics. Mosaic art flourished in the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 15th centuries; that tradition was adopted by the Norman kingdom in Sicily in the 12th century, by eastern-influenced Venice, and among the Rus in Ukraine. Mosaic fell out of fashion in the Renaissance, though artists like Raphael continued to practise the old technique.

"In an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material (detritus)). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the ""donor"" organism(s).",69,What is predation in an ecosystem?,a biological interaction,—,—,—,1,"አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ,ecosystem predation እዩ ሓደ biological ምትሕብባር አበይ ሓደ predator (ሓደ organism እቲ እዩ )hunting feeds አብ ልዕሊ ናቱ ግዳይ (እቲ organism እቲ እዩ ).attacked Predators ተዝኸዉን ወይ ተዝኸዉን ዘይኮነ ምቕታል ናቶም ግዳይ ቅድሚያ ናብ feeding አብ ልዕሊ ,ንሶም ግን እቲ ፍፃመ ካብ predation ኩል ግዘ ውፅኢታት አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ሞት ካብ እቲ ግዳይ እና እቲ eventual absorption ካብ እቲ 'prey's ቲሹ ብውሽጢ .ምህላኽ ስለዝኾነ predation እዩ ,ኩል ግዘ እኳ ዘይኮነ ,ወትሪ .carnivory ካልእ categories ካብ ምህላኽ እዮም herbivory (ምብላዕ parts ካብ ),ተኽልታት fungivory (ምብላዕ parts ካብ ),fungi እና detritivory (እቲ ምህላኽ ካብ ምውት organic ናውቲ ()).detritus ኩሎም እዚ ምህላኽ categories ምውዳቅ ትሕቲ እቲ rubric ካብ -consumer-resource .systems እቲ ነገር ይኽእል ኩል ግዘ ኩን ከቢድ ናብ ፍለ ዝተፈላለዩ types ካብ feeding .behaviors ን ,ኣብነት ንእሽተይ parasitic ዓሌታት ግዳይ አብ ልዕሊ ሓደ መዳለዊ organism እና ሽዑ ምውዳቕ ናቶም eggs አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ነገር ን ናቶም offspring ናብ ምምጋብ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ነገር እስካብ እቲ ነገር continues ናብ ንበር አብ ውሽጢ ወይ አብ ልዕሊ ናቱ decaying corpse ድሕሪ እቲ ነገር ኣለዎ .ሞይቱ እቲ መፍትሕ characteristic ካብ predation ዋላኳ ተኾነ እዩ እቲ 'predator's ቕጥታ ፅልዋ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ግዳይ .በዝሒ ህዝቢ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ካልእ ,ኢድ detritivores simply ብላዕ ምውት organic ናውቲ arising ካብ እቲ ሙሽሙሽ ካብ ምውት individuals እና ኣለኒ አይኮንን ቕጥታ ፅልዋ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ """"donor ().organism(s",እንታይ እዩ predation አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ?ecosystem,ሓደ biological ምትሕብባር,—,—,—

"Upon his election to the papacy, Montini took the pontifical name Paul VI (the first to take the name ""Paul"" since 1605) to indicate a renewed worldwide mission to spread the message of Christ, following the example of Apostle St. Paul.[citation needed] He re-convened the Second Vatican Council, which was automatically closed with the death of John XXIII, and gave it priority and direction. After the council had concluded its work, Paul VI took charge of the interpretation and implementation of its mandates, often walking a thin line between the conflicting expectations of various groups within Catholicism. The magnitude and depth of the reforms affecting all fields of Church life during his pontificate exceeded similar reform policies of his predecessors and successors. Paul VI was a Marian devotee, speaking repeatedly to Marian congresses and mariological meetings, visiting Marian shrines and issuing three Marian encyclicals. Following his famous predecessor Saint Ambrose of Milan, he named Mary as the Mother of the Church during the Second Vatican Council. Paul VI sought dialogue with the world, with other Christians, other religions, and atheists, excluding nobody. He saw himself as a humble servant for a suffering humanity and demanded significant changes of the rich in North America and Europe in favour of the poor in the Third World. His positions on birth control, promulgated most famously in the 1968 encyclical Humanae vitae, and other political issues, were often controversial, especially in Western Europe and North America.",71,What name was the pontiff given after Montini's election to the papacy?,North America,Paul,Western Europe,the Second Vatican Council,2,"ኣብ ግዘ ናቱ election ናብ እቲ ,papacy Montini ምውሳድ እቲ pontifical ሽም Paul VI (እቲ መጀመርታ ናብ ውሰድ እቲ ሽም """"Paul ካብ )1605 ናብ ምምልካት ሓደ renewed worldwide ተልእኾ ናብ ምዝርጋሕ እቲ መልእኽቲ ካብ ,Christ ምኽታል እቲ ኣብነት ካብ Apostle .ቅዱስ .[Paul.[citation ]needed ንሱ -re-convened እቲ ካልኣይ Vatican ,ዋዕላ አየናይ ኔሩ automatically closed ምስ እቲ ሞት ካብ John ,XXIII እና ሂቡ እቲ ነገር ቀዳምነት እና .ኣንፈት ድሕሪ እቲ ዋዕላ ዝነበረ concluded ናቱ ,ስራሕ Paul VI ምውሳድ ኣኽፍል ካብ እቲ interpretation እና implementation ካብ ናቱ ,mandates ኩል ግዘ ምኻድ ሓደ ቀጢን መስመር አብ መንጎ እቲ conflicting expectations ካብ ዝተፈላለዩ groups አብ ውሽጢ .Catholicism እቲ magnitude እና ዕምቈት ካብ እቲ reforms affecting ኩሎም fields ካብ ቤተ ክርስትያን ህይወት አብ እዋን ናቱ pontificate exceeded ተመሳሳሊ reform policies ካብ ናቱ predecessors እና .successors Paul VI ኔሩ ሓደ Marian ,devotee speaking repeatedly ናብ Marian congresses እና mariological ,meetings visiting Marian shrines እና issuing ሰለስተ Marian .encyclicals ምኽታል ናቱ ተፈላጢ predecessor Saint Ambrose ካብ ,Milan ንሱ named Mary ከም እቲ ኣዶ ካብ እቲ ቤተ ክርስትያን አብ እዋን እቲ ካልኣይ Vatican .ዋዕላ Paul VI ድሌት dialogue ምስ እቲ ,ዓለም ምስ ካልእ ,Christians ካልእ ,religions እና ,atheists excluding .ዋላ ሓደ ንሱ ሪኤ himself ከም ሓደ ትሑት servant ን ሓደ ይሳቐ humanity እና demanded ግዙፍ changes ካብ እቲ ሓፍታም አብ ውሽጢ ሰሜን America እና Europe አብ ውሽጢ ፍትወት ካብ እቲ ድኻ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ሳልሳይ .ዓለም ናቱ positions አብ ልዕሊ birth ,ምቁጽጻር promulgated ብጥዕሚ famously አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 1968 encyclical Humanae ,vitae እና ካልእ political ,ፀገማት ኔሮም ኩል ግዘ ,ዘከራኽር ብፍላይ አብ ውሽጢ Western Europe እና ሰሜን .America",እንታይ ሽም ኔሩ እቲ pontiff ዝተወሃበ ድሕሪ 'Montini's election ናብ እቲ ?papacy,ሰሜን America,Paul,Western Europe,እቲ ካልኣይ Vatican ዋዕላ
"A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions. Sometimes the status of great powers is formally recognized in conferences such as the Congress of Vienna or an international structure such as the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States serve as the body's five permanent members).

However, this has the result that there is no objective definition of what constitutes ""literature""; anything can be literature, and anything which is universally regarded as literature has the potential to be excluded, since value-judgements can change over time.",74,"What book uses a definition that views literature as ""the best expression of the best thought reduced to writing""?",—,the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition,—,—,2,"እቲ ዋጋ judgement ኣገላልፃ ካብ ስነ ጽሑፍ considers እቲ ነገር ናብ exclusively ይሓውስ ምጽሓፍ እቲ possesses ላዕሊ ፅፈት ወይ ,distinction forming ክፋል ካብ እቲ -so-called -belles-lettres ('ደሓን ')ምጽሓፍ .ልምዲ እዚ እዩ እቲ ኣገላልፃ ዘገልገለ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition ()1910–11 መዓዝ እቲ ነገር classifies ስነ ጽሑፍ ከም ""እቲ ምሩፅ ኣገላልፃ ካብ እቲ ምሩፅ ሓሳብ reduced ናብ .""ምጽሓፍ ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ እዚ ኣለዎ እቲ ውፅኢት እቲ ኣብቲ እዩ አይኮንን ዕላማ ኣገላልፃ ካብ እንታይ constitutes """";ስነ ጽሑፍ ምንም ነገር ይኽእል ኩን ,ስነ ጽሑፍ እና ምንም ነገር አየናይ እዩ universally regarded ከም ስነ ጽሑፍ ኣለዎ እቲ ውሽጣዊ ዓቅሚ ናብ ኩን ,excluded ካብ -value-judgements ይኽእል ለውጢ ልዕሊ .ግዜ","እንታይ መፅሓፍ uses ሓደ ኣገላልፃ እቲ views ስነ ጽሑፍ ከም ""እቲ ምሩፅ ኣገላልፃ ካብ እቲ ምሩፅ ሓሳብ reduced ናብ ""?ምጽሓፍ",—,እቲ Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition,—,—

Jesus was stripped of his clothing and offered wine mixed with gall to drink, before being crucified. He was then hung for six hours (according to Mark's Gospel) between two convicted thieves. During this time, the soldiers affixed a sign to the top of the cross stating ""Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews"" in three languages.

Gramont, the French foreign minister, declared that he felt ""he had just received a slap"". The leader of the monarchists in Parliament, Adolphe Thiers, spoke for moderation, arguing that France had won the diplomatic battle and there was no reason for war, but he was drowned out by cries that he was a traitor and a Prussian. Napoleon's new prime minister, Emile Ollivier, declared that France had done all that it could humanly and honorably do to prevent the war, and that he accepted the responsibility ""with a light heart.""

"U.S. President Barack Obama has rarely used the term, but in his inaugural address on 20 January 2009, he stated ""Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred."" In March 2009 the Defense Department officially changed the name of operations from ""Global War on Terror"" to ""Overseas Contingency Operation"" (OCO). In March 2009, the Obama administration requested that Pentagon staff members avoid use of the term, instead using ""Overseas Contingency Operation"". Basic objectives of the Bush administration ""war on terror"", such as targeting al Qaeda and building international counterterrorism alliances, remain in place. In December 2012, Jeh Johnson, the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, stated that the military fight will be replaced by a law enforcement operation when speaking at Oxford University, predicting that al Qaeda will be so weakened to be ineffective, and has been ""effectively destroyed"", and thus the conflict will not be an armed conflict under international law. In May 2013, Obama stated that the goal is ""to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America""; which coincided with the U.S. Office of Management and Budget having changed the wording from ""Overseas Contingency Operations"" to ""Countering Violent Extremism"" in 2010.",82,"When was the global war on terror officially changed to ""Overseas Contingency Operation""?",Pentagon,March 2009,Overseas Contingency Operations,Overseas Contingency Operation,2,"..U.S ፕረዝደንት Barack Obama ኣለዎ ሓልሓሊፉ ዘገልገለ እቲ ,ቃል ግን አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ inaugural አድራሻ አብ ልዕሊ 20 ጥሪ ,2009 ንሱ stated ""ናትና nation እዩ ኣብ ,ውግእ ተቃራኒ ሓደ -far-reaching መርበብ ሓበሬታ ካብ ዓመጽ እና .""hatred አብ ውሽጢ መጋቢት 2009 እቲ Defense ክፍሊ officially changed እቲ ሽም ካብ operations ካብ ""ዓለምለኻዊ ውግእ አብ ልዕሊ ""Terror ናብ ""Overseas Contingency ""ስርሒት ().OCO አብ ውሽጢ መጋቢት ,2009 እቲ Obama administration requested እቲ Pentagon ሰራሕተኛታት members አወግድ ጥቅሚ ካብ እቲ ,ቃል ከክንዲ using ""Overseas Contingency "".ስርሒት መሰረታዊ objectives ካብ እቲ ቈጥቋጥ administration ""ውግእ አብ ልዕሊ "",terror ከምዚ ከም targeting al Qaeda እና ምህናፅ ዓለም ለኻዊ counterterrorism ,alliances ምፅናሕ አብ ውሽጢ .ቦታ አብ ውሽጢ ታሕሳስ ,2012 Jeh ,Johnson እቲ ሓፈሻዊ Counsel ካብ እቲ ክፍሊ ካብ ,Defense stated እቲ እቲ ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት ባእሲ ንመፃእ ኩን replaced ብ ሓደ ሕጊ enforcement ስርሒት መዓዝ speaking ኣብ Oxford ,ዩኒቨርሲቲ predicting እቲ al Qaeda ንመፃእ ኩን ስለዚ weakened ናብ ኩን ,ineffective እና ኣለዎ ዝነበረ ""effectively "",destroyed እና ስለዝኾነ እቲ ባእሲ ንመፃእ ዘይኮነ ኩን ሓደ armed ባእሲ ትሕቲ ዓለም ለኻዊ .ሕጊ አብ ውሽጢ ተዝኸዉን ,2013 Obama stated እቲ እቲ ሽቶ እዩ ""ናብ dismantle ዝተወሰነ networks ካብ ዓመጸና extremists እቲ ምፍርራሕ "";America አየናይ coincided ምስ እቲ ..U.S ቤት-ፅሕፈት ካብ ምሕደራ እና በጀት ምህላው changed እቲ wording ካብ ""Overseas Contingency ""Operations ናብ ""Countering ዓመጸና ""Extremism አብ ውሽጢ .2010","መዓዝ ኔሩ እቲ ዓለምለኻዊ ውግእ አብ ልዕሊ terror officially changed ናብ ""Overseas Contingency ""?ስርሒት",Pentagon,መጋቢት 2009,Overseas Contingency Operations,Overseas Contingency ስርሒት

"Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking countries to the set of architectural styles current between 1714 and 1830. It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover—George I, George II, George III, and George IV—who reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830. The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture. In America the term ""Georgian"" is generally used to describe all building from the period, regardless of style; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are ""architectural in intention"", and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period, though that covers a wide range.",90,In what language is Georgian architecture defined?,George IV,between 1714 and 1830,George II,English,4,"Georgian ኣርክቴክቸር እዩ እቲ ሽም ዝተወሃበ አብ ውሽጢ ብጥዕሚ -English-speaking countries ናብ እቲ ፅምዲ ካብ architectural styles እዋናዊ አብ መንጎ 1714 እና .1830 እቲ ነገር እዩ eponymous ን እቲ መጀመርታ ዓርባዕተ British monarchs ካብ እቲ ገዛ ካብ Hanover—George ,ኣነ George ,II George ,III እና George IV—who reigned አብ ውሽጢ continuous succession ካብ ነሓሰ 1714 ናብ ሰነ .1830 እቲ ኣገባብ ኔሩ revived አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ረፋድ 19th ዘመን አብ ውሽጢ እቲ United States ከም Colonial Revival ኣርክቴክቸር እና አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ብግዘ 20th ዘመን አብ ውሽጢ ምዑዝ Britain ከም -Neo-Georgian ;ኣርክቴክቸር አብ ውሽጢ ክልቲኡ እቲ ነገር እዩ እውን ዝተፀወዐ Georgian Revival .ኣርክቴክቸር አብ ውሽጢ America እቲ ቃል """"Georgian እዩ ብሓፈሻ ዘገልገለ ናብ ግለፅ ኩሎም ምህናፅ ካብ እቲ ,ግዘ ብዘየግድስ ካብ ;ኣገባብ አብ ውሽጢ Britain እቲ ነገር እዩ ብሓፈሻ restricted ናብ buildings እቲ እዮም ""architectural አብ ውሽጢ "",ሓሳብ እና ኣለኒ stylistic ባህርያት እቲ እዮም ዝተለመደ ካብ እቲ ,ግዘ እኳ እቲ covers ሓደ ሰፊሕ .ግዝፈት",አብ ውሽጢ እንታይ ቋንቋ እዩ Georgian ኣርክቴክቸር ?defined,George IV,አብ መንጎ 1714 እና 1830,George II,ኢንግሊሽ
"The beginning of the Neolithic culture is considered to be in the Levant (Jericho, modern-day West Bank) about 10,200 – 8,800 BC. It developed directly from the Epipaleolithic Natufian culture in the region, whose people pioneered the use of wild cereals, which then evolved into true farming. The Natufian period was between 12,000 and 10,200 BC, and the so-called ""proto-Neolithic"" is now included in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPNA) between 10,200 and 8,800 BC.

Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant.

"On 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly recommended the adoption and implementation of the Partition Plan for Mandatory Palestine. This UN plan specified borders for new Arab and Jewish states and also specified an area of Jerusalem and its environs which was to be administered by the UN under an international regime. The end of the British Mandate for Palestine was set for midnight on 14 May 1948. That day, David Ben-Gurion, the executive head of the Zionist Organization and president of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, declared ""the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel,"" which would start to function from the termination of the mandate. The borders of the new state were not specified in the declaration. Neighboring Arab armies invaded the former Palestinian mandate on the next day and fought the Israeli forces. Israel has since fought several wars with neighboring Arab states, in the course of which it has occupied the West Bank, Sinai Peninsula (1956–57, 1967–82), part of Southern Lebanon (1982–2000), Gaza Strip (1967–2005; still considered occupied after 2005 disengagement) and the Golan Heights. It extended its laws to the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem, but not the West Bank. Efforts to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict have not resulted in peace. However, peace treaties between Israel and both Egypt and Jordan have successfully been signed.

"Based on the similar shifts underway the nation's economy after 1960, Philadelphia experienced a loss of manufacturing companies and jobs to lower taxed regions of the USA and often overseas. As a result, the economic base of Philadelphia, which had historically been manufacturing, declined significantly. In addition, consolidation in several American industries (retailing, financial services and health care in particular) reduced the number of companies headquartered in Philadelphia. The economic impact of these changes would reduce Philadelphia's tax base and the resources of local government. Philadelphia struggled through a long period of adjustment to these economic changes, coupled with significant demographic change as wealthier residents moved into the nearby suburbs and more immigrants moved into the city. The city in fact approached bankruptcy in the late 1980s.

"The first known European explorer to reach Bermuda was Spanish sea captain Juan de Bermúdez in 1503, after whom the islands are named. He claimed the apparently uninhabited islands for the Spanish Empire. Paying two visits to the archipelago, Bermúdez never landed on the islands, but did create a recognisable map of the archipelago. Shipwrecked Portuguese mariners are now thought to have been responsible for the 1543 inscription in Portuguese Rock (previously called Spanish Rock). Subsequent Spanish or other European parties are believed to have released pigs there, which had become feral and abundant on the island by the time European settlement began. In 1609, the English Virginia Company, which had established Jamestown in Virginia (a term originally applied to all of the North American continent) two years earlier, permanently settled Bermuda in the aftermath of a hurricane, when the crew and passengers of the Sea Venture steered the ship onto the surrounding reef to prevent its sinking, then landed ashore.",116,Who was the first European explorer to reach Bermuda?,1503,Juan de Bermúdez,two years earlier,first,2,"እቲ መጀመርታ ፍሉጥ European explorer ናብ ብፅሕ Bermuda ኔሩ ስጳኛ ባሕሪ captain Juan de Bermúdez አብ ውሽጢ ,1503 ድሕሪ መን እቲ islands እዮም .named ንሱ claimed እቲ እስካብ ዝፈልጦ uninhabited islands ን እቲ ስጳኛ .Empire Paying ክልተ visits ናብ እቲ ,archipelago Bermúdez ፍፁም landed አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ,islands ግን ግቡር ፍጠር ሓደ recognisable map ካብ እቲ .archipelago Shipwrecked Portuguese mariners እዮም ሕዚ ሓሳብ ናብ ኣለኒ ዝነበረ ሓላፍነት ዝወስድ ን እቲ 1543 inscription አብ ውሽጢ Portuguese ከውሒ (previously ዝተፀወዐ ስጳኛ ).ከውሒ Subsequent ስጳኛ ወይ ካልእ European parties እዮም believed ናብ ኣለኒ ተለቒቑ pigs ,ኣብቲ አየናይ ዝነበረ ምዃን feral እና ኣኺሉ ዝተረፈ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ደሴት ብ እቲ ግዜ European settlement .ጀሚሩ አብ ውሽጢ ,1609 እቲ ኢንግሊሽ Virginia ,ድርጅት አየናይ ዝነበረ ዝተመስረተ Jamestown አብ ውሽጢ Virginia (ሓደ ቃል originally applied ናብ ኩሎም ካብ እቲ ሰሜን American )ኣህጉር ክልተ ዓመታት ,ኣቕድም ኣቢሉ permanently settled Bermuda አብ ውሽጢ እቲ aftermath ካብ ሓደ ,ህቦብላ ንፋስ መዓዝ እቲ ጀምዓ እና passengers ካብ እቲ ባሕሪ ኣብ ሓደጋ ኣውደቐ steered እቲ መርከብ onto እቲ ከባቢ reef ናብ ምክልኻል ናቱ ,sinking ሽዑ landed .ashore",መን ኔሩ እቲ መጀመርታ European explorer ናብ ብፅሕ ?Bermuda,1503,Juan de Bermúdez,ክልተ ዓመታት ኣቕድም ኣቢሉ,መጀመርታ

"Baird Television Ltd. made Britain's first television broadcast, on 30 September 1929 from its studio in Long Acre, London, via the BBC's London transmitter, using the electromechanical system pioneered by John Logie Baird. This system used a vertically-scanned image of 30 lines – just enough resolution for a close-up of one person, and with a bandwidth low enough to use existing radio transmitters. Simultaneous transmission of sound and picture was achieved on 30 March 1930, by using the BBC's new twin transmitter at Brookmans Park. By late 1930, 30 minutes of morning programmes were broadcast Monday to Friday, and 30 minutes at midnight on Tuesdays and Fridays, after BBC radio went off the air.

"Fossilized spores suggest that higher plants (embryophytes) have lived on land for at least 475 million years. Early land plants reproduced sexually with flagellated, swimming sperm, like the green algae from which they evolved. An adaptation to terrestrialization was the development of upright meiosporangia for dispersal by spores to new habitats. This feature is lacking in the descendants of their nearest algal relatives, the Charophycean green algae. A later terrestrial adaptation took place with retention of the delicate, avascular sexual stage, the gametophyte, within the tissues of the vascular sporophyte. This occurred by spore germination within sporangia rather than spore release, as in non-seed plants. A current example of how this might have happened can be seen in the precocious spore germination in Selaginella, the spike-moss. The result for the ancestors of angiosperms was enclosing them in a case, the seed. The first seed bearing plants, like the ginkgo, and conifers (such as pines and firs), did not produce flowers. The pollen grains (males) of Ginkgo and cycads produce a pair of flagellated, mobile sperm cells that ""swim"" down the developing pollen tube to the female and her eggs.",133,How long did plant spores have lived on land?,Ginkgo,at least 475 million years,first,sporangia,2,"Fossilized spores ሓሳብ ምቕራብ እቲ higher ተኽልታት ()embryophytes ኣለኒ lived አብ ልዕሊ መሬት ን ኣብ ዝነኣሰ 475 ሚልዮን .ዓመታት ብግዘ መሬት ተኽልታት reproduced sexually ምስ ,flagellated ምሕማስ ,sperm ምፍታው እቲ ቆፅለዋይ algae ካብ አየናይ ንሶም .evolved ሓደ adaptation ናብ terrestrialization ኔሩ እቲ ዕብየት ካብ upright meiosporangia ን dispersal ብ spores ናብ ሓድሽ .habitats እዚ መለለዩ እዩ lacking አብ ውሽጢ እቲ descendants ካብ ናቶም nearest algal ,ዘመዳት እቲ Charophycean ቆፅለዋይ .algae ሓደ ዳሕራይ terrestrial adaptation ምውሳድ ቦታ ምስ ምዕቃብ ካብ እቲ ,ረቂቕ avascular sexual ,መድረኽ እቲ ,gametophyte አብ ውሽጢ እቲ tissues ካብ እቲ vascular .sporophyte እዚ ዝተፈጠረ ብ spore germination አብ ውሽጢ sporangia ይመርፅ ካብ spore ,ስደድ ከም አብ ውሽጢ -non-seed .ተኽልታት ሓደ እዋናዊ ኣብነት ካብ ከመይ እዚ ይኸዉን ኣለኒ ተፈጢሩ ይኽእል ኩን ተራእዩ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ precocious spore germination አብ ውሽጢ ,Selaginella እቲ -.spike-moss እቲ ውፅኢት ን እቲ ዓሌት ካብ angiosperms ኔሩ enclosing ንሶም አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ,ጉዳይ እቲ .ዘርኢ እቲ መጀመርታ ዘርኢ ምጿር ,ተኽልታት ምፍታው እቲ ,ginkgo እና conifers (ከምዚ ከም pines እና ),firs ግቡር ዘይኮነ ምፍራይ .flowers እቲ pollen grains ()males ካብ Ginkgo እና cycads ምፍራይ ሓደ ጽምዲ ካብ ,flagellated ተንቀሳቓሲ sperm cells እቲ """"ምሕማስ ታሕቲ እቲ developing pollen ቱቦ ናብ እቲ ኣንስተይቲ እና ንሳ .eggs",ከመይ ነዊሕ ግቡር ተኽሊ spores ኣለኒ lived አብ ልዕሊ ?መሬት,Ginkgo,ኣብ ዝነኣሰ 475 ሚልዮን ዓመታት,መጀመርታ,sporangia

"After boiling, the hopped wort is now cooled, ready for the yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation.

"There are typically 40 million bacterial cells in a gram of soil and a million bacterial cells in a millilitre of fresh water. There are approximately 5×1030 bacteria on Earth, forming a biomass which exceeds that of all plants and animals. Bacteria are vital in recycling nutrients, with many of the stages in nutrient cycles dependent on these organisms, such as the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere and putrefaction. In the biological communities surrounding hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds, such as hydrogen sulphide and methane, to energy. On 17 March 2013, researchers reported data that suggested bacterial life forms thrive in the Mariana Trench, which with a depth of up to 11 kilometres is the deepest part of the Earth's oceans. Other researchers reported related studies that microbes thrive inside rocks up to 580 metres below the sea floor under 2.6 kilometres of ocean off the coast of the northwestern United States.

"The Crimean War was a military conflict fought between October 1853 – March 1856 in which Russia lost to an alliance of France, the United Kingdom, the Ottoman Empire, and Sardinia. The immediate cause involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land, which was controlled by the Ottoman Empire. The French promoted the rights of Catholics, while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Christians. The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of the United Kingdom and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at Ottoman expense. It has widely been noted that the causes, in one case involving an argument over a key, have never revealed a ""greater confusion of purpose"", yet led to a war noted for its ""notoriously incompetent international butchery.""",145,Which war was the Crimean war known as?,The Crimean War,Catholics,Christians,Christian,1,"እቲ Crimean ውግእ ኔሩ ሓደ ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት ባእሲ ተባኣሰ አብ መንጎ ጥቅምቲ 1853 – መጋቢት 1856 አብ ውሽጢ አየናይ Russia ዝጠፈአ ናብ ሓደ alliance ካብ ,France እቲ United ,Kingdom እቲ Ottoman ,Empire እና .Sardinia እቲ ሽዕ ንሻዕ ጠንቂ ዝተኻተተ እቲ rights ካብ Christian minorities አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Holy ,መሬት አየናይ ኔሩ controlled ብ እቲ Ottoman .Empire እቲ French promoted እቲ rights ካብ ,Catholics እስካብ Russia promoted እቲኦም ካብ እቲ Eastern Orthodox .Christians እቲ -longer-term causes ዝተኻተተ እቲ ኣውድቅ ካብ እቲ Ottoman Empire እና እቲ unwillingness ካብ እቲ United Kingdom እና France ናብ ፍቀድ Russia ናብ ርኸብ ግዝኣት እና ሓይሊ ኣብ Ottoman .expense እቲ ነገር ኣለዎ widely ዝነበረ ተመዝጊቡ እቲ እቲ ,causes አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ጉዳይ involving ሓደ ክትዕ ልዕሊ ሓደ ,መፍትሕ ኣለኒ ፍፁም ዝተቓልዐ ሓደ ""greater ምድንጋራት ካብ "",ዕላማ እስካብ ዛሕዚ መረሐ ናብ ሓደ ውግእ ተመዝጊቡ ን ናቱ ""notoriously incompetent ዓለም ለኻዊ .""butchery",አየናይ ውግእ ኔሩ እቲ Crimean ውግእ ፍሉጥ ?ከም,እቲ Crimean ውግእ,Catholics,Christians,Christian

"The domestication of poultry took place several thousand years ago. This may have originally been as a result of people hatching and rearing young birds from eggs collected from the wild, but later involved keeping the birds permanently in captivity. Domesticated chickens may have been used for cockfighting at first and quail kept for their songs, but soon it was realised how useful it was having a captive-bred source of food. Selective breeding for fast growth, egg-laying ability, conformation, plumage and docility took place over the centuries, and modern breeds often look very different from their wild ancestors. Although some birds are still kept in small flocks in extensive systems, most birds available in the market today are reared in intensive commercial enterprises. Poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat globally and, along with eggs, provides nutritionally beneficial food containing high-quality protein accompanied by a low proportion of fat.

"Typically an antenna consists of an arrangement of metallic conductors (elements), electrically connected (often through a transmission line) to the receiver or transmitter. An oscillating current of electrons forced through the antenna by a transmitter will create an oscillating magnetic field around the antenna elements, while the charge of the electrons also creates an oscillating electric field along the elements. These time-varying fields radiate away from the antenna into space as a moving transverse electromagnetic field wave. Conversely, during reception, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of an incoming radio wave exert force on the electrons in the antenna elements, causing them to move back and forth, creating oscillating currents in the antenna.",151,What type of conductors are generally used in an antenna?,antenna,—,metallic conductors,—,3,"Typically ሓደ antenna consists ካብ ሓደ መስርዕ ካብ metallic conductors (),elements electrically connected (ኩል ግዘ ብውሽጢ ሓደ transmission )መስመር ናብ እቲ receiver ወይ .transmitter ሓደ oscillating እዋናዊ ካብ electrons forced ብውሽጢ እቲ antenna ብ ሓደ transmitter ንመፃእ ፍጠር ሓደ oscillating magnetic ሜዳ አብ ከባቢ እቲ antenna ,elements እስካብ እቲ ኣኽፍል ካብ እቲ electrons እውን creates ሓደ oscillating electric ሜዳ ማዕረ ኣንፈት እቲ .elements እዚ -time-varying fields radiate ንየ ካብ እቲ antenna ናብ ውሽጢ ቦታ ከም ሓደ moving transverse electromagnetic ሜዳ .ማዕበል ,Conversely አብ እዋን ,መቐበሊ ጋሻ እቲ oscillating electric እና magnetic fields ካብ ሓደ incoming radio ማዕበል exert ሓይሊ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ electrons አብ ውሽጢ እቲ antenna ,elements causing ንሶም ናብ ምንቅስቓስ ዝባን እና ,forth creating oscillating currents አብ ውሽጢ እቲ .antenna",እንታይ ዓይነት ካብ conductors እዮም ብሓፈሻ ዘገልገለ አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ?antenna,antenna,—,metallic conductors,—

"Circadian rhythms allow organisms to anticipate and prepare for precise and regular environmental changes. They thus enable organisms to best capitalize on environmental resources (e.g. light and food) compared to those that cannot predict such availability. It has therefore been suggested that circadian rhythms put organisms at a selective advantage in evolutionary terms. However, rhythmicity appears to be as important in regulating and coordinating internal metabolic processes, as in coordinating with the environment. This is suggested by the maintenance (heritability) of circadian rhythms in fruit flies after several hundred generations in constant laboratory conditions, as well as in creatures in constant darkness in the wild, and by the experimental elimination of behavioral, but not physiological, circadian rhythms in quail.",157,What type of circadian rhythms enable organisms to anticipate and prepare for frequent changes?,—,Circadian,—,several hundred,2,"Circadian rhythms ፍቀድ organisms ናብ ግምት እና ተዳሎ ን ምጽግጋዕ እና ልሙድ environmental .changes ንሶም ስለዝኾነ ኣኽእል organisms ናብ ምሩፅ capitalize አብ ልዕሊ environmental ምንጭታት (..e.g ብርሃን እና )ምግቢ compared ናብ እቲኦም እቲ cannot ምትንባይ ከምዚ .availability እቲ ነገር ኣለዎ ስለዚ ድማ ዝነበረ suggested እቲ circadian rhythms አቅምጥ organisms ኣብ ሓደ selective ጥቅሚ አብ ውሽጢ evolutionary .ስያመታት ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ rhythmicity appears ናብ ኩን ከም ጠቃሚ አብ ውሽጢ regulating እና coordinating ውሽጣዊ metabolic ,processes ከም አብ ውሽጢ coordinating ምስ እቲ .ከባቢ እዚ እዩ suggested ብ እቲ ፅገና ()heritability ካብ circadian rhythms አብ ውሽጢ ፍረ flies ድሕሪ ቡዙሓት ሚእቲ generations አብ ውሽጢ ቀዋሚ laboratory ,ኩነታት ከም ደሓን ከም አብ ውሽጢ creatures አብ ውሽጢ ቀዋሚ darkness አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ,ልቂ እና ብ እቲ experimental elimination ካብ ,behavioral ግን ዘይኮነ ,physiological circadian rhythms አብ ውሽጢ .quail",እንታይ ዓይነት ካብ circadian rhythms ኣኽእል organisms ናብ ግምት እና ተዳሎ ን ብተደጋጋሚ ?changes,—,Circadian,—,ቡዙሓት ሚእቲ

"The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War rivals, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US), for supremacy in spaceflight capability. It had its origins in the missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II, enabled by captured German rocket technology and personnel. The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security, and symbolic of ideological superiority. The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites, unmanned space probes of the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon. The competition began on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year, by declaring they would also launch a satellite ""in the near future"". The Soviet Union beat the US to this, with the October 4, 1957 orbiting of Sputnik 1, and later beat the US to the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin, on April 12, 1961. The Space Race peaked with the July 20, 1969 US landing of the first humans on the Moon with Apollo 11. The USSR tried but failed manned lunar missions, and eventually cancelled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations. A period of détente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co-operative Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew.",160,What decade did the Space Race occur?,four days earlier,20th-century,"August 2, 1955",first,2,"እቲ ቦታ ዘርኢ ኔሩ ሓደ -20th-century ውድድር አብ መንጎ ክልተ ቁሪ ውግእ ,rivals እቲ Soviet Union ()USSR እና እቲ United States (),ንሕና ን supremacy አብ ውሽጢ spaceflight .capability እቲ ነገር ዝነበረ ናቱ origins አብ ውሽጢ እቲ -missile-based nuclear arms ዘርኢ አብ መንጎ እቲ ክልተ nations እቲ ዝተፈጠረ ምኽታል ዓለም ውግእ ,II enabled ብ captured German rocket ቴክኖሎጂ እና .personnel እቲ technological superiority ዘድሊ ን ከምዚ supremacy ኔሩ ተራእዩ ከም አድላዩ ን ሃገራዊ ,ድሕንነት እና symbolic ካብ ideological .superiority እቲ ቦታ ዘርኢ spawned pioneering efforts ናብ ኣወንጭፍ ሰብ ሰራሕ ,satellites unmanned ቦታ probes ካብ እቲ ,ወርሒ ,Venus እና ,Mars እና ሰብ spaceflight አብ ውሽጢ ውሑድ መሬት orbit እና ናብ እቲ .ወርሒ እቲ ውድድር ጀሚሩ አብ ልዕሊ ነሓሰ ,2 ,1955 መዓዝ እቲ Soviet Union responded ናብ እቲ ንሕና ምልክታ ዓርባዕተ days ኣቕድም ኣቢሉ ካብ intent ናብ ኣወንጭፍ ሰብ ሰራሕ satellites ን እቲ ዓለም ለኻዊ Geophysical ,ዓመት ብ declaring ንሶም ይኸውን እውን ኣወንጭፍ ሓደ satellite ""አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ጥቃ "".መፃእ እቲ Soviet Union ምሽናፍ እቲ ንሕና ናብ ,እዚ ምስ እቲ ጥቅምቲ ,4 1957 orbiting ካብ Sputnik ,1 እና ዳሕራይ ምሽናፍ እቲ ንሕና ናብ እቲ መጀመርታ ሰብ አብ ውሽጢ ,ቦታ Yuri ,Gagarin አብ ልዕሊ ጉንበት ,12 .1961 እቲ ቦታ ዘርኢ peaked ምስ እቲ ሓምለ ,20 1969 ንሕና landing ካብ እቲ መጀመርታ humans አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ወርሒ ምስ Apollo .11 እቲ USSR ሞከረ ግን ወዲቑ manned lunar ,missions እና ብኽይዲ cancelled ንሶም እና concentrated አብ ልዕሊ መሬት orbital ቦታ .stations ሓደ ግዘ ካብ détente followed ምስ እቲ ጉንበት 1972 ውዕሊ አብ ልዕሊ ሓደ -co-operative Apollo–Soyuz ፈተና ,ፕሮጀክት resulting አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ሓምለ 1975 rendezvous አብ ውሽጢ መሬት orbit ካብ ሓደ ንሕና astronaut ጀምዓ ምስ ሓደ Soviet cosmonaut .ጀምዓ",እንታይ ዓሰርተ ዓመት ግቡር እቲ ቦታ ዘርኢ ?ይፍፀም,ዓርባዕተ days ኣቕድም ኣቢሉ,-20th-century,"ነሓሰ ,2 1955",መጀመርታ

"Compression is useful because it helps reduce resource usage, such as data storage space or transmission capacity. Because compressed data must be decompressed to use, this extra processing imposes computational or other costs through decompression; this situation is far from being a free lunch. Data compression is subject to a space–time complexity trade-off. For instance, a compression scheme for video may require expensive hardware for the video to be decompressed fast enough to be viewed as it is being decompressed, and the option to decompress the video in full before watching it may be inconvenient or require additional storage. The design of data compression schemes involves trade-offs among various factors, including the degree of compression, the amount of distortion introduced (when using lossy data compression), and the computational resources required to compress and decompress the data.",162,What is a benefit of compression?,—,—,—,resource usage,4,"Compression እዩ ጠቃሚ ምኽንያቱ እቲ ነገር helps ቀንስ resource ,usage ከምዚ ከም ሰነድ መኽዚን ቦታ ወይ transmission .ትኽእሎ ምኽንያቱ compressed ሰነድ ግድን ኩን decompressed ናብ ,ጥቅሚ እዚ ተወሳኺ processing imposes computational ወይ ካልእ costs ብውሽጢ ;decompression እዚ ኩነታት እዩ ርሑቅ ካብ ፍጥረት ሓደ ነፃ .ምሳሕ ሰነድ compression እዩ ዋና ናብ ሓደ space–time complexity -.trade-off ን ,ኣብነት ሓደ compression scheme ን ቪዲዮ ተዝኸዉን ይደሊ ክባር hardware ን እቲ ቪዲዮ ናብ ኩን decompressed ቅልጡፍ እኹል ናብ ኩን viewed ከም እቲ ነገር እዩ ፍጥረት ,decompressed እና እቲ መማረጺ ናብ decompress እቲ ቪዲዮ አብ ውሽጢ ሙሉእ ቅድሚ watching እቲ ነገር ተዝኸዉን ኩን inconvenient ወይ ይደሊ ተወሳኺ .መኽዚን እቲ ንድፊ ካብ ሰነድ compression schemes involves -trade-offs ካብዞም ዝተፈላለዩ ,factors ይሓውስ እቲ መዐቀኒ ካብ ,compression እቲ መጠን ካብ distortion introduced (መዓዝ using lossy ሰነድ ),compression እና እቲ computational ምንጭታት ዘድሊ ናብ compress እና decompress እቲ .ሰነድ",እንታይ እዩ ሓደ ጥቕሚ ካብ ?compression,—,—,—,resource usage

The round-back has a deep bottom, constructed of strips of wood, glued together into a bowl. The carved-top or arch-top mandolin has a much shallower, arched back, and an arched top—both carved out of wood. The flat-backed mandolin uses thin sheets of wood for the body, braced on the inside for strength in a similar manner to a guitar. Each style of instrument has its own sound quality and is associated with particular forms of music. Neapolitan mandolins feature prominently in European classical music and traditional music.

"Royal assent is the method by which a country's constitutional monarch (possibly through a delegated official) formally approves an act of that nation's parliament, thus making it a law or letting it be promulgated as law. In the vast majority of contemporary monarchies, this act is considered to be little more than a formality; even in those nations which still permit their ruler to withhold the royal assent (such as the United Kingdom, Norway, and Liechtenstein), the monarch almost never does so, save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government.

"European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools (scholae monasticae), in which monks and nuns taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century. The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the Latin Church by papal bull as studia generalia and perhaps from cathedral schools. It is possible, however, that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception. Later they were also founded by Kings (University of Naples Federico II, Charles University in Prague, Jagiellonian University in Kraków) or municipal administrations (University of Cologne, University of Erfurt). In the early medieval period, most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education.

"Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989.

A series of famines and plagues, including the Great Famine of 1315–1317 and the Black Death, reduced the population to around half of what it was before the calamities. Along with depopulation came social unrest and endemic warfare. France and England experienced serious peasant uprisings, such as the Jacquerie and the Peasants' Revolt, as well as over a century of intermittent conflict in the Hundred Years' War. To add to the many problems of the period, the unity of the Catholic Church was shattered by the Western Schism.

"Robert Plutchik agreed with Ekman's biologically driven perspective but developed the ""wheel of emotions"", suggesting eight primary emotions grouped on a positive or negative basis: joy versus sadness; anger versus fear; trust versus disgust; and surprise versus anticipation. Some basic emotions can be modified to form complex emotions. The complex emotions could arise from cultural conditioning or association combined with the basic emotions. Alternatively, similar to the way primary colors combine, primary emotions could blend to form the full spectrum of human emotional experience. For example, interpersonal anger and disgust could blend to form contempt.

"In 1744, Burke started at Trinity College Dublin, a Protestant establishment, which up until 1793, did not permit Catholics to take degrees. In 1747, he set up a debating society, ""Edmund Burke's Club"", which, in 1770, merged with TCD's Historical Club to form the College Historical Society; it is the oldest undergraduate society in the world. The minutes of the meetings of Burke's Club remain in the collection of the Historical Society. Burke graduated from Trinity in 1748.

"Namibia (i/nəˈmɪbiə/, /næˈ-/), officially the Republic of Namibia (German:  Republik Namibia (help·info); Afrikaans: Republiek van Namibië) is a country in southern Africa whose western border is the Atlantic Ocean. It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east. Although it does not border Zimbabwe, a part of less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates it from that country. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence.

"Robert Plutchik agreed with Ekman's biologically driven perspective but developed the ""wheel of emotions"", suggesting eight primary emotions grouped on a positive or negative basis: joy versus sadness; anger versus fear; trust versus disgust; and surprise versus anticipation. Some basic emotions can be modified to form complex emotions. The complex emotions could arise from cultural conditioning or association combined with the basic emotions. Alternatively, similar to the way primary colors combine, primary emotions could blend to form the full spectrum of human emotional experience. For example, interpersonal anger and disgust could blend to form contempt.

"The area now called Galicia was first inhabited by humans during the Middle Paleolithic period, and it takes its name from the Gallaeci, the Celtic peoples living north of the Douro river during the last millennium BC, in a region largely coincidental with that of the Iron Age local Castro culture. Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, being turned into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal) which was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585. In 711, the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula, taking the Visigoth kingdom, but soon in 740 Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias. During the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings, but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom of Leon and later to that of Castile, while maintaining its own legal and customary practices and personality. From the 13th century on, the kings of Castile, as kings of Galicia, appointed an Adiantado-mór, whose attributions passed to the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza from the last years of the 15th century. The Governor also presided the Real Audiencia do Reino de Galicia, a royal tribunal and government body. From the 16th century, the representation and voice of the kingdom was held by an assembly of deputies and representatives of the cities of the kingdom, the Cortes or Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia, an institution which was forcibly discontinued in 1833 when the kingdom was divided into four administrative provinces with no legal mutual links. During the 19th and 20th centuries, demand grew for self-government and for the recognition of the personality of Galicia, a demand which led to the frustrated Statute of Autonomy of 1936, and to the Statute of Autonomy of 1981, currently in force.",202,What is the Celtic name of the area today called Galicia?,1981,the 19th and 20th centuries,19,Gallaeci,4,"እቲ ስፍሓት ሕዚ ዝተፀወዐ Galicia ኔሩ መጀመርታ inhabited ብ humans አብ እዋን እቲ ማእኸል Paleolithic ,ግዘ እና እቲ ነገር takes ናቱ ሽም ካብ እቲ ,Gallaeci እቲ Celtic peoples ምንባር ሰሜን ካብ እቲ Douro ሩባ አብ እዋን እቲ መጨረሻ millennium ,BC አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ክልል largely coincidental ምስ እቲ ካብ እቲ ሓፂን ዕድመ ወሽጣዊ Castro .ባህሊ Galicia ኔሩ incorporated ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ Roman Empire ኣብ እቲ መወዳእታ ካብ እቲ Cantabrian Wars አብ ውሽጢ 19 ,BC ፍጥረት turned ናብ ውሽጢ ሓደ Roman ገጸር አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 3rd ዘመን .AD አብ ውሽጢ ,410 እቲ Germanic Suebi ዝተመስረተ ሓደ kingdom ምስ ናቱ ሃብቲ አብ ውሽጢ Braga ()Portugal አየናይ ኔሩ incorporated ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ ካብ እቲ Visigoths አብ ውሽጢ .585 አብ ውሽጢ ,711 እቲ Arabs invaded እቲ Iberian ,Peninsula taking እቲ Visigoth ,kingdom ግን አብ ቀረባ አብ ውሽጢ 740 Galicia ኔሩ incorporated ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ Christian kingdom ካብ .Asturias አብ እዋን እቲ ማእኸል ,Ages እቲ kingdom ካብ Galicia ኔሩ ሕልፍ ሕልፍ ኢሉ ruled ብ ናቱ ወንን ,kings ግን ብጥዕሚ ካብ እቲ ግዜ እቲ ነገር ኔሩ leagued ናብ እቲ kingdom ካብ Leon እና ዳሕራይ ናብ እቲ ካብ ,Castile እስካብ maintaining ናቱ ወንን ሕጋዊ እና customary practices እና .ባህርያት ካብ እቲ 13th ዘመን ,አብ ልዕሊ እቲ kings ካብ ,Castile ከም kings ካብ ,Galicia appointed ሓደ -,Adiantado-mór ናይ መን attributions ሓሊፉ ናብ እቲ Governor እና Captain ሓፈሻዊ ካብ እቲ Kingdom ካብ Galiza ካብ እቲ መጨረሻ ዓመታት ካብ እቲ 15th .ዘመን እቲ Governor እውን presided እቲ ሓቂ Audiencia ግበር Reino de ,Galicia ሓደ royal tribunal እና መንግስቲ .ሰውነት ካብ እቲ 16th ,ዘመን እቲ representation እና ድምፂ ካብ እቲ kingdom ኔሩ ተገይሩ ብ ሓደ ኣኼባ ካብ deputies እና representatives ካብ እቲ cities ካብ እቲ ,kingdom እቲ Cortes ወይ Junta ካብ እቲ Kingdom ካብ ,Galicia ሓደ institution አየናይ ኔሩ forcibly discontinued አብ ውሽጢ 1833 መዓዝ እቲ kingdom ኔሩ divided ናብ ውሽጢ ዓርባዕተ administrative provinces ምስ አይኮንን ሕጋዊ ሓበራዊ ጥቕሚ .links አብ እዋን እቲ 19th እና 20th ,centuries ተጠላብነት grew ን -self-government እና ን እቲ ተፈላጥነት ካብ እቲ ባህርያት ካብ ,Galicia ሓደ ተጠላብነት አየናይ መረሐ ናብ እቲ ከልከለ Statute ካብ Autonomy ካብ ,1936 እና ናብ እቲ Statute ካብ Autonomy ካብ ,1981 አብዚ ሕዚ አብ ውሽጢ .ሓይሊ",እንታይ እዩ እቲ Celtic ሽም ካብ እቲ ስፍሓት ሎምዓንቲ ዝተፀወዐ ?Galicia,1981,እቲ 19th እና 20th centuries,19,Gallaeci

"Royal assent is the method by which a country's constitutional monarch (possibly through a delegated official) formally approves an act of that nation's parliament, thus making it a law or letting it be promulgated as law. In the vast majority of contemporary monarchies, this act is considered to be little more than a formality; even in those nations which still permit their ruler to withhold the royal assent (such as the United Kingdom, Norway, and Liechtenstein), the monarch almost never does so, save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government.

In 1724, Mughal viceroy Asif Jah I declared his sovereignty and created his own dynasty, known as the Nizams of Hyderabad. The Nizam's dominions became a princely state during the British Raj, and remained so for 150 years, with the city serving as its capital. The Nizami influence can still be seen in the culture of the Hyderabadi Muslims. The city continued as the capital of Hyderabad State after it was brought into the Indian Union in 1948, and became the capital of Andhra Pradesh after the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. Since 1956, Rashtrapati Nilayam in the city has been the winter office of the President of India.

"From outside the United Kingdom and the United States, the Canadian trio Rush released three distinctively hard rock albums in 1974–75 (Rush, Fly by Night and Caress of Steel) before moving toward a more progressive sound with the 1976 album 2112. The Irish band Thin Lizzy, which had formed in the late 1960s, made their most substantial commercial breakthrough in 1976 with the hard rock album Jailbreak and their worldwide hit ""The Boys Are Back in Town"", which reached number 8 in the UK and number 12 in the US. Their style, consisting of two duelling guitarists often playing leads in harmony, proved itself to be a large influence on later bands. They reached their commercial, and arguably their artistic peak with Black Rose: A Rock Legend (1979). The arrival of Scorpions from Germany marked the geographical expansion of the subgenre. Australian-formed AC/DC, with a stripped back, riff heavy and abrasive style that also appealed to the punk generation, began to gain international attention from 1976, culminating in the release of their multi-platinum albums Let There Be Rock (1977) and Highway to Hell (1979). Also influenced by a punk ethos were heavy metal bands like Motörhead, while Judas Priest abandoned the remaining elements of the blues in their music, further differentiating the hard rock and heavy metal styles and helping to create the New Wave of British Heavy Metal which was pursued by bands like Iron Maiden, Saxon and Venom.",219,"Who is the Irish band that released the album ""The Boys Are Back In Town""?",three,2112,Canadian,Thin Lizzy,4,"ካብ ደገ እቲ United Kingdom እና እቲ United ,States እቲ Canadian trio ችኮላ ተለቒቑ ሰለስተ distinctively ከቢድ ከውሒ albums አብ ውሽጢ 1974–75 (,ችኮላ ንፈር ብ ምሸት እና Caress ካብ )ሓጺን ቅድሚ moving ንቕድሚት ሓደ ቡዙሕ progressive ድምጺ ምስ እቲ 1976 album .2112 እቲ Irish ባንድ ቀጢን ,Lizzy አየናይ ዝነበረ formed አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ረፋድ ,1960s ዝተሰርሐ ናቶም ብጥዕሚ substantial ንግዳዊ breakthrough አብ ውሽጢ 1976 ምስ እቲ ከቢድ ከውሒ album Jailbreak እና ናቶም worldwide በሎ ""እቲ Boys እዮም ዝባን አብ ውሽጢ "",ንእሽተይ ከተማ አየናይ በጸሐ ቑጽሪ 8 አብ ውሽጢ እቲ UK እና ቑጽሪ 12 አብ ውሽጢ እቲ .ንሕና ናቶም ,ኣገባብ consisting ካብ ክልተ duelling guitarists ኩል ግዘ ምፅዋት leads አብ ውሽጢ ,ስኒት proved itself ናብ ኩን ሓደ ገዚፍ ተፅዕኖ አብ ልዕሊ ዳሕራይ .bands ንሶም በጸሐ ናቶም ,ንግዳዊ እና arguably ናቶም artistic ጫፍ ምስ ፀሊም :Rose ሓደ ከውሒ ኣፈ ታሪኽ ().1979 እቲ ምምጻእ ካብ Scorpions ካብ Germany marked እቲ geographical expansion ካብ እቲ .subgenre -Australian-formed /,AC/DC ምስ ሓደ stripped ,ዝባን riff ከቢድ እና abrasive ኣገባብ እቲ እውን appealed ናብ እቲ punk ,ወለዶ ጀሚሩ ናብ ርኸብ ዓለም ለኻዊ ቀልቢ ካብ ,1976 culminating አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ስደድ ካብ ናቶም -multi-platinum albums ይኹን ኣብቲ ኩን ከውሒ ()1977 እና Highway ናብ ገሃነም ().1979 እውን influenced ብ ሓደ punk ethos ኔሮም ከቢድ ሓጺን bands ምፍታው ,Motörhead እስካብ Judas ቀሺ ምቁራጽ እቲ ዝተረፈ elements ካብ እቲ blues አብ ውሽጢ ናቶም ,ሙዚቃ ርሑቅ differentiating እቲ ከቢድ ከውሒ እና ከቢድ ሓጺን styles እና helping ናብ ፍጠር እቲ ሓድሽ ማዕበል ካብ British ከቢድ ሓጺን አየናይ ኔሩ pursued ብ bands ምፍታው ሓፂን ,Maiden Saxon እና .መርዚ","መን እዩ እቲ Irish ባንድ እቲ ተለቒቑ እቲ album ""እቲ Boys እዮም ዝባን አብ ውሽጢ ""?ንእሽተይ ከተማ",ሰለስተ,2112,Canadian,ቀጢን Lizzy
"Korea was ruled by Japan from 1910 until the closing days of World War II. In August 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and—by agreement with the United States—occupied Korea north of the 38th parallel. U.S. forces subsequently occupied the south and Japan surrendered. By 1948, two separate governments had been set up. Both governments claimed to be the legitimate government of Korea, and neither side accepted the border as permanent. The conflict escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces—supported by the Soviet Union and China—invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950. On that day, the United Nations Security Council recognized this North Korean act as invasion and called for an immediate ceasefire. On 27 June, the Security Council adopted S/RES/83: Complaint of aggression upon the Republic of Korea and decided the formation and dispatch of the UN Forces in Korea.

"Typically an antenna consists of an arrangement of metallic conductors (elements), electrically connected (often through a transmission line) to the receiver or transmitter.

Nigeria has one of the largest populations of youth in the world. The country is viewed as a multinational state, as it is inhabited by over 500 ethnic groups, of which the three largest are the Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba; these ethnic groups speak over 500 different languages, and are identified with wide variety of cultures. The official language is English. Nigeria is divided roughly in half between Christians, who live mostly in the southern part of the country, and Muslims in the northern part.

"Depleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter).",225,What makes depleted uranium more effective than lead in stopping radiation?,—,its high density,—,—,2,"Depleted uranium እዩ እውን ዘገልገለ ከም ሓደ shielding ናውቲ አብ ውሽጢ ንእሽተይ containers ዘገልገለ ናብ መኽዝን እና መጓዓዝያ radioactive .materials እስካብ እቲ ሓጺን itself እዩ ,radioactive ናቱ ላዕሊ ፃዕቒ makes እቲ ነገር ቡዙሕ ውፅኢታዊ ካብ ምራሕ አብ ውሽጢ halting radiation ካብ ጠንካራ sources ከምዚ ከም .radium ካልእ uses ካብ depleted uranium ይሓውስ counterweights ን aircraft ምቁጽጻር ,surfaces ከም ballast ን missile -re-entry vehicles እና ከም ሓደ shielding .ናውቲ መወዳእታ ናብ ናቱ ላዕሊ ,ፃዕቒ እዚ ናውቲ እዩ ተረኺቡ አብ ውሽጢ inertial ሓጋዚ systems እና አብ ውሽጢ gyroscopic .compasses Depleted uranium እዩ preferred ልዕሊ similarly dense metals መወዳእታ ናብ ናቱ ተኽእሎ ናብ ኩን ብቐሊሉ machined እና ምስሊ ከም ደሓን ከም ናቱ relatively ውሑድ .ዋጋ እቲ ዋና ሓደጋ ካብ ተቃላዕነት ናብ depleted uranium እዩ chemical poisoning ብ uranium oxide ይመርፅ ካብ radioactivity (uranium ፍጥረት ጥራሕ ሓደ ድኹም alpha ).emitter",እንታይ makes depleted uranium ቡዙሕ ውፅኢታዊ ካብ ምራሕ አብ ውሽጢ stopping ?radiation,—,ናቱ ላዕሊ ፃዕቒ,—,—

"Copper occurs naturally as native copper and was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record. It has a history of use that is at least 10,000 years old, and estimates of its discovery place it at 9000 BC in the Middle East; a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC. There is evidence that gold and meteoric iron (but not iron smelting) were the only metals used by humans before copper. The history of copper metallurgy is thought to have followed the following sequence: 1) cold working of native copper, 2) annealing, 3) smelting, and 4) the lost wax method. In southeastern Anatolia, all four of these metallurgical techniques appears more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic c. 7500 BC. However, just as agriculture was independently invented in several parts of the world, copper smelting was invented locally in several different places. It was probably discovered independently in China before 2800 BC, in Central America perhaps around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting was invented in 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK at 2280 to 1890 BC. Ötzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300–3200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest his involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led to the discovery of iron smelting. Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.[citation needed]",227,When did the discovery of copper occur in the Middle East?,99.7%,1,BC,four,3,"ነሓስ ኮነ naturally ከም መበቆል ነሓስ እና ኔሩ ፍሉጥ ናብ ንእሽተይ ካብ እቲ oldest civilizations አብ ልዕሊ .ቅዳሕ እቲ ነገር ኣለዎ ሓደ ታሪኽ ካብ ጥቅሚ እቲ እዩ ኣብ ዝነኣሰ ,10,000 ዓመታት ,ዓብይ እና estimates ካብ ናቱ discovery ቦታ እቲ ነገር ኣብ 9000 BC አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ማእኸል ;ምብራቅ ሓደ ነሓስ pendant ኔሩ ተረኺቡ አብ ውሽጢ northern Iraq እቲ dates ናብ 8700 .BC ኣብቲ እዩ ማስረጃ እቲ ወርቂ እና meteoric ሓፂን (ግን ዘይኮነ ሓፂን )smelting ኔሮም እቲ ጥራሕ metals ዘገልገለ ብ humans ቅድሚ .ነሓስ እቲ ታሪኽ ካብ ነሓስ metallurgy እዩ ሓሳብ ናብ ኣለኒ followed እቲ ምኽታል :ቕደም ስዓብ )1 ቁሪ ምስራሕ ካብ መበቆል ,ነሓስ )2 ,annealing )3 ,smelting እና )4 እቲ ዝጠፈአ wax .ሜላ አብ ውሽጢ southeastern ,Anatolia ኩሎም ዓርባዕተ ካብ እዚ metallurgical techniques appears ቡዙሕ ወይ ዝወሓደ ብተኻታታሊ ኣብ እቲ መጀመርታ ካብ እቲ Neolithic .c 7500 .BC ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ጥራሕ ከም ግብርና ኔሩ independently invented አብ ውሽጢ ቡዙሓት parts ካብ እቲ ,ዓለም ነሓስ smelting ኔሩ invented locally አብ ውሽጢ ቡዙሓት ፍሉይ .ቦታታት እቲ ነገር ኔሩ ናይ ምዃን ዕድል discovered independently አብ ውሽጢ China ቅድሚ 2800 ,BC አብ ውሽጢ Central America ምናልባት አብ ከባቢ 600 ,AD እና አብ ውሽጢ ምዕራብ Africa ብዝዕባ እቲ 9th ወይ 10th ዘመን .AD Investment casting ኔሩ invented አብ ውሽጢ 4500–4000 BC አብ ውሽጢ Southeast Asia እና carbon dating ኣለዎ ዝተመስረተ mining ኣብ Alderley ጫፍ አብ ውሽጢ ,Cheshire UK ኣብ 2280 ናብ 1890 .BC Ötzi እቲ ,Iceman ሓደ ተባዕታይ dated ካብ 3300–3200 ,BC ኔሩ ተረኺቡ ምስ ሓደ axe ምስ ሓደ ነሓስ ርእሲ .%99.7 ;ፅሩይ ላዕሊ levels ካብ arsenic አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ ፀጉሪ ሓሳብ ምቕራብ ናቱ involvement አብ ውሽጢ ነሓስ .smelting ተሞክሮ ምስ ነሓስ ኣለዎ assisted እቲ ዕብየት ካብ ካልእ ;metals አብ ውሽጢ ,ብፍሉይ ነሓስ smelting መረሐ ናብ እቲ discovery ካብ ሓፂን .smelting ምህርቲ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ዓብይ ነሓስ ሕውስዋስ አብ ውሽጢ Michigan እና Wisconsin እዩ dated አብ መንጎ 6000 እና 3000 .BC ተፈጥራዊ ,bronze ሓደ ዓይነት ካብ ነሓስ ዝተሰርሐ ካብ ores ሓፍታም አብ ውሽጢ ,silicon ,arsenic እና ()ሓልሓሊፉ ,tin መጺኡ ናብ ውሽጢ ሓፈሻዊ ጥቅሚ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Balkans አብ ከባቢ 5500 .[BC.[citation ]needed",መዓዝ ግቡር እቲ discovery ካብ ነሓስ ይፍፀም አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ማእኸል ?ምብራቅ,.%99.7,1,BC,ዓርባዕተ

"South Slavic dialects historically formed a continuum. The turbulent history of the area, particularly due to expansion of the Ottoman Empire, resulted in a patchwork of dialectal and religious differences.

As a strategic location in the Middle East, it was subsequently occupied by several major powers, including the empires of the Assyrians, Egyptians and Persians, from whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great. Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt, the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire, Arab caliphates for a short period, the French Lusignan dynasty and the Venetians, was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 (de jure until 1914).",237,When did earliest human activity on Cyprus begin?,between 1571 and 1878,Neolithic,10th,Mycenaean Greeks,3,"እቲ earliest ፍሉጥ ሰብ ንጥፈት አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ደሴት dates ናብ አብ ከባቢ እቲ 10th millennium .BC Archaeological remains ካብ እዚ ግዘ ይሓውስ እቲ -well-preserved Neolithic ገጠር ካብ ,Khirokitia እና Cyprus እዩ ገዛ ናብ ንእሽተይ ካብ እቲ oldest ማይ wells አብ ውሽጢ እቲ .ዓለም Cyprus ኔሩ settled ብ Mycenaean Greeks አብ ውሽጢ ክልተ waves አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 2nd millennium .BC ከም ሓደ strategic ኣንፈት አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ማእኸል ,ምብራቅ እቲ ነገር ኔሩ subsequently ብስራሕ ትሑዝ ብ ቡዙሓት ዋና ,powers ይሓውስ እቲ empires ካብ እቲ ,Assyrians Egyptians እና ,Persians ካብ መን እቲ ደሴት ኔሩ seized አብ ውሽጢ 333 BC ብ Alexander እቲ .ምዑዝ Subsequent ስርዓት ብ Ptolemaic ,Egypt እቲ Classical እና Eastern Roman ,Empire Arab caliphates ን ሓደ ሓፂር ,ግዘ እቲ French Lusignan dynasty እና እቲ ,Venetians ኔሩ followed ብ ልዕሊ ሰለስተ centuries ካብ Ottoman ስርዓት አብ መንጎ 1571 እና 1878 (de jure ክሳብ ).1914",መዓዝ ግቡር earliest ሰብ ንጥፈት አብ ልዕሊ Cyprus ?ጀምር,አብ መንጎ 1571 እና 1878,Neolithic,10th,Mycenaean Greeks

"Perhaps the first electric motors were simple electrostatic devices created by the Scottish monk Andrew Gordon in the 1740s. The theoretical principle behind production of mechanical force by the interactions of an electric current and a magnetic field, Ampère's force law, was discovered later by André-Marie Ampère in 1820. The conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy by electromagnetic means was demonstrated by the British scientist Michael Faraday in 1821. A free-hanging wire was dipped into a pool of mercury, on which a permanent magnet (PM) was placed. When a current was passed through the wire, the wire rotated around the magnet, showing that the current gave rise to a close circular magnetic field around the wire. This motor is often demonstrated in physics experiments, brine substituting for toxic mercury. Though Barlow's wheel was an early refinement to this Faraday demonstration, these and similar homopolar motors were to remain unsuited to practical application until late in the century.",242,Who discovered the theory behind the production of mechanical force by the interactions of an electric current and a magnetic field?,Ampère,British,first,the 1740s,1,"ምናልባት እቲ መጀመርታ electric motors ኔሮም ቀሊል electrostatic devices created ብ እቲ Scottish monk Andrew Gordon አብ ውሽጢ እቲ .1740s እቲ theoretical principle ብድሕሪ ምህርቲ ካብ mechanical ሓይሊ ብ እቲ interactions ካብ ሓደ electric እዋናዊ እና ሓደ magnetic ,ሜዳ 'Ampère's ሓይሊ ,ሕጊ ኔሩ discovered ዳሕራይ ብ -André-Marie Ampère አብ ውሽጢ .1820 እቲ conversion ካብ electrical ጉልበት ናብ ውሽጢ mechanical ጉልበት ብ electromagnetic ማለት ኔሩ demonstrated ብ እቲ British ሳይንቲስት Michael Faraday አብ ውሽጢ .1821 ሓደ -free-hanging ገመድ ኔሩ dipped ናብ ውሽጢ ሓደ መሐመሲ ካብ ,mercury አብ ልዕሊ አየናይ ሓደ ቀዋሚ magnet ()PM ኔሩ .placed መዓዝ ሓደ እዋናዊ ኔሩ ሓሊፉ ብውሽጢ እቲ ,ገመድ እቲ ገመድ rotated አብ ከባቢ እቲ ,magnet showing እቲ እቲ እዋናዊ ሂቡ ምልዓል ናብ ሓደ ዕፁው circular magnetic ሜዳ አብ ከባቢ እቲ .ገመድ እዚ motor እዩ ኩል ግዘ demonstrated አብ ውሽጢ physics ,experiments brine substituting ን መርዛም .mercury እኳ 'Barlow's መንኮርኮር ኔሩ ሓደ ብግዘ refinement ናብ እዚ Faraday ,demonstration እዚ እና ተመሳሳሊ homopolar motors ኔሮም ናብ ምፅናሕ unsuited ናብ ብተግባር ማመልከቻ ክሳብ ረፋድ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ .ዘመን",መን discovered እቲ ሓሳብ ብድሕሪ እቲ ምህርቲ ካብ mechanical ሓይሊ ብ እቲ interactions ካብ ሓደ electric እዋናዊ እና ሓደ magnetic ?ሜዳ,Ampère,British,መጀመርታ,እቲ 1740s

"The Space Race can trace its origins to Germany, beginning in the 1930s and continuing during World War II when Nazi Germany researched and built operational ballistic missiles. Starting in the early 1930s, during the last stages of the Weimar Republic, German aerospace engineers experimented with liquid-fueled rockets, with the goal that one day they would be capable of reaching high altitudes and traversing long distances. The head of the German Army's Ballistics and Munitions Branch, Lieutenant Colonel Karl Emil Becker, gathered a small team of engineers that included Walter Dornberger and Leo Zanssen, to figure out how to use rockets as long-range artillery in order to get around the Treaty of Versailles' ban on research and development of long-range cannons. Wernher von Braun, a young engineering prodigy, was recruited by Becker and Dornberger to join their secret army program at Kummersdorf-West in 1932. Von Braun had dreams about conquering outer space with rockets, and did not initially see the military value in missile technology.",247,When did The Space Race start?,Becker,Von Braun,the 1930s,one day,3,"እቲ ቦታ ዘርኢ ይኽእል ኣሰር ናቱ origins ናብ ,Germany መጀመርታ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 1930s እና continuing አብ እዋን ዓለም ውግእ II መዓዝ Nazi Germany researched እና ተሃኒጹ operational ballistic .missiles Starting አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ብግዘ ,1930s አብ እዋን እቲ መጨረሻ stages ካብ እቲ Weimar ,Republic German aerospace engineers experimented ምስ -liquid-fueled ,rockets ምስ እቲ ሽቶ እቲ ሓደ መዓልቲ ንሶም ይኸውን ኩን ተኽእሎ ዘለዎ ካብ reaching ላዕሊ altitudes እና traversing ነዊሕ .distances እቲ ርእሲ ካብ እቲ German 'Army's Ballistics እና Munitions ,ቅርንጫፍ Lieutenant Colonel Karl Emil ,Becker gathered ሓደ ንኡስ ጉጅለ ካብ engineers እቲ included Walter Dornberger እና Leo ,Zanssen ናብ ስእሊ ደገ ከመይ ናብ ጥቅሚ rockets ከም -long-range artillery አብ ውሽጢ ስርዓት ናብ ምርካብ አብ ከባቢ እቲ Treaty ካብ 'Versailles ban አብ ልዕሊ ፅንዓት እና ዕብየት ካብ -long-range .cannons Wernher von ,Braun ሓደ ንእሽተይ engineering ,prodigy ኔሩ recruited ብ Becker እና Dornberger ናብ ተሓወስ ናቶም ምሽጥር ሰራዊት program ኣብ -Kummersdorf-West አብ ውሽጢ .1932 Von Braun ዝነበረ dreams ብዝዕባ conquering outer ቦታ ምስ ,rockets እና ግቡር ዘይኮነ initially ረአ እቲ ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት ዋጋ አብ ውሽጢ missile .ቴክኖሎጂ",መዓዝ ግቡር እቲ ቦታ ዘርኢ ?ጀምር,Becker,Von Braun,እቲ 1930s,ሓደ መዓልቲ

"The Macintosh, however, was expensive, which hindered its ability to be competitive in a market already dominated by the Commodore 64 for consumers, as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses. Macintosh systems still found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade. In the 1990s, improvements in the rival Wintel platform, notably with the introduction of Windows 3.0, then Windows 95, gradually took market share from the more expensive Macintosh systems. The performance advantage of 68000-based Macintosh systems was eroded by Intel's Pentium, and in 1994 Apple was relegated to third place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer.

"There are many styles of mandolin, but four are common, the Neapolitan or round-backed mandolin, the carved-top mandolin and the flat-backed mandolin. The round-back has a deep bottom, constructed of strips of wood, glued together into a bowl. The carved-top or arch-top mandolin has a much shallower, arched back, and an arched top—both carved out of wood. The flat-backed mandolin uses thin sheets of wood for the body, braced on the inside for strength in a similar manner to a guitar. Each style of instrument has its own sound quality and is associated with particular forms of music. Neapolitan mandolins feature prominently in European classical music and traditional music.

By 1910, Seattle was one of the 25 largest cities in the country. However, the Great Depression severely damaged the city's economy. Growth returned during and after World War II, due partially to the local Boeing company, which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing. The Seattle area developed as a technology center beginning in the 1980s, with companies like Microsoft becoming established in the region. In 1994 the Internet retail giant Amazon was founded in Seattle.

"The relative pitches of individual notes in a scale may be determined by one of a number of tuning systems. In the west, the twelve-note chromatic scale is the most common method of organization, with equal temperament now the most widely used method of tuning that scale. In it, the pitch ratio between any two successive notes of the scale is exactly the twelfth root of two (or about 1.05946). In well-tempered systems (as used in the time of Johann Sebastian Bach, for example), different methods of musical tuning were used. Almost all of these systems have one interval in common, the octave, where the pitch of one note is double the frequency of another. For example, if the A above middle C is 440 Hz, the A an octave above that is 880 Hz (info).",262,What is the pitch ratio between any two successive notes of the scale exactly?,about 1.05946,880 Hz,Johann Sebastian Bach,twelfth,4,"እቲ ዘመድ pitches ካብ ውልቀ ሰብ notes አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ መለክዒ ተዝኸዉን ኩን ብጉስ ብ ሓደ ካብ ሓደ ቑጽሪ ካብ tuning .systems አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ,ምዕራብ እቲ -twelve-note chromatic መለክዒ እዩ እቲ ብጥዕሚ ልሙድ ሜላ ካብ ,ውድብ ምስ ማዕረ temperament ሕዚ እቲ ብጥዕሚ widely ዘገልገለ ሜላ ካብ tuning እቲ .መለክዒ አብ ውሽጢ ,እቲ ነገር እቲ ጫፍ መጠነ ዝምድና አብ መንጎ ዝኾነ ክልተ successive notes ካብ እቲ መለክዒ እዩ ብልክዕ እቲ twelfth ሱር ካብ ክልተ (ወይ ብዝዕባ .).1.05946 አብ ውሽጢ -well-tempered systems (ከም ዘገልገለ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ግዜ ካብ Johann Sebastian ,Bach ን ),ኣብነት ፍሉይ methods ካብ musical tuning ኔሮም .ዘገልገለ ዳርጋ ኩሎም ካብ እዚ systems ኣለኒ ሓደ interval አብ ውሽጢ ,ልሙድ እቲ ,octave አበይ እቲ ጫፍ ካብ ሓደ መዝገብ እዩ ዕፅፊ እቲ ድግግም ካብ .ካልእ ን ,ኣብነት እንተ እቲ ሓደ ኣብ ልዕሊ ማእኸል C እዩ 440 ,Hz እቲ ሓደ ሓደ octave ኣብ ልዕሊ እቲ እዩ 880 Hz ().info",እንታይ እዩ እቲ ጫፍ መጠነ ዝምድና አብ መንጎ ዝኾነ ክልተ successive notes ካብ እቲ መለክዒ ?ብልክዕ,ብዝዕባ .1.05946,880 Hz,Johann Sebastian Bach,twelfth
"London i/ˈlʌndən/ is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom. Standing on the River Thames in the south eastern part of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it Londinium. London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its 1.12-square-mile (2.9 km2) medieval boundaries and in 2011 had a resident population of 7,375, making it the smallest city in England. Since at least the 19th century, the term London has also referred to the metropolis developed around this core. The bulk of this conurbation forms Greater London,[note 1] a region of England governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.[note 2] The conurbation also covers two English counties: the small district of the City of London and the county of Greater London.

Many of these technologies, such as the Media space, are not as widely used today as videoconferencing but were still an important area of research.

"Realizing that war was imminent, Prussia preemptively struck Saxony and quickly overran it. The result caused uproar across Europe. Because of Prussia's alliance with Britain, Austria formed an alliance with France, seeing an opportunity to recapture Silesia, which had been lost in a previous war. Reluctantly, by following the imperial diet, most of the states of the empire joined Austria's cause. The Anglo-Prussian alliance was joined by smaller German states (especially Hanover).

"The English word scientist is relatively recent—first coined by William Whewell in the 19th century. Previously, people investigating nature called themselves natural philosophers. While empirical investigations of the natural world have been described since classical antiquity (for example, by Thales, Aristotle, and others), and scientific methods have been employed since the Middle Ages (for example, by Ibn al-Haytham, and Roger Bacon), the dawn of modern science is often traced back to the early modern period and in particular to the scientific revolution that took place in 16th- and 17th-century Europe. Scientific methods are considered to be so fundamental to modern science that some consider earlier inquiries into nature to be pre-scientific.

"In 1636 George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, ruler of the Brunswick-Lüneburg principality of Calenberg, moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692, and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its electors would later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who ruled in Hanover was William IV. Semi-Salic law, which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.

The hot filament is protected from oxidation with a glass or quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated. In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is prevented by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life.

In August 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and—by agreement with the United States—occupied Korea north of the 38th parallel. U.S. forces subsequently occupied the south and Japan surrendered. By 1948, two separate governments had been set up. Both governments claimed to be the legitimate government of Korea, and neither side accepted the border as permanent. The conflict escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces—supported by the Soviet Union and China—invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950. On that day, the United Nations Security Council recognized this North Korean act as invasion and called for an immediate ceasefire. On 27 June, the Security Council adopted S/RES/83: Complaint of aggression upon the Republic of Korea and decided the formation and dispatch of the UN Forces in Korea.

"All the objects from everyday life that we can bump into, touch or squeeze are composed of atoms. This atomic matter is in turn made up of interacting subatomic particles—usually a nucleus of protons and neutrons, and a cloud of orbiting electrons. Typically, science considers these composite particles matter because they have both rest mass and volume. By contrast, massless particles, such as photons, are not considered matter, because they have neither rest mass nor volume. However, not all particles with rest mass have a classical volume, since fundamental particles such as quarks and leptons (sometimes equated with matter) are considered ""point particles"" with no effective size or volume. Nevertheless, quarks and leptons together make up ""ordinary matter"", and their interactions contribute to the effective volume of the composite particles that make up ordinary matter.",283,"What are all the everyday objects that we can bump into, touch or squeeze composed of?",atoms,identification particle.n.01,grinding.n.01,chylomicron.n.01,1,"ኩሎም እቲ objects ካብ everyday ህይወት እቲ ንሕና ይኽእል ምጉርምራም ,ናብ ውሽጢ ምንካእ ወይ ምጽሟቕ እዮም composed ካብ .atoms እዚ atomic ነገር እዩ አብ ውሽጢ ተጠወ ዝተሰርሐ ሓፍ ካብ interacting subatomic particles—usually ሓደ nucleus ካብ protons እና ,neutrons እና ሓደ ደበና ካብ orbiting .electrons ,Typically ሳይንስ considers እዚ composite particles ነገር ምኽንያቱ ንሶም ኣለኒ ክልቲኡ ዕረፍቲ መጠን ኣካል እና .ትሕዝቶ ብ ,ኣወዳደረ massless ,particles ከምዚ ከም ,photons እዮም ዘይኮነ ገምገመ ,ነገር ምኽንያቱ ንሶም ኣለኒ ዋላ ዕረፍቲ መጠን ኣካል እውን ኣይኮነን .ትሕዝቶ ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ዘይኮነ ኩሎም particles ምስ ዕረፍቲ መጠን ኣካል ኣለኒ ሓደ classical ,ትሕዝቶ ካብ መሰረታዊ particles ከምዚ ከም quarks እና leptons (ሓደ ሓደ ግዘ equated ምስ )ነገር እዮም ገምገመ ""ነጥቢ ""particles ምስ አይኮንን ውፅኢታዊ ግዝፊ ወይ .ትሕዝቶ ,ምንም ብዘየገድስ quarks እና leptons ብሓባር ስራሕ ሓፍ ""ተራ "",ነገር እና ናቶም interactions ኣዋፅእ ናብ እቲ ውፅኢታዊ ትሕዝቶ ካብ እቲ composite particles እቲ ስራሕ ሓፍ ተራ .ነገር","እንታይ እዮም ኩሎም እቲ everyday objects እቲ ንሕና ይኽእል ምጉርምራም ,ናብ ውሽጢ ምንካእ ወይ ምጽሟቕ composed ?ካብ",atoms,identification ..particle.n.01,..grinding.n.01,..chylomicron.n.01
"Hoover began using wiretapping in the 1920s during Prohibition to arrest bootleggers. In the 1927 case Olmstead v. United States, in which a bootlegger was caught through telephone tapping, the United States Supreme Court ruled that FBI wiretaps did not violate the Fourth Amendment as unlawful search and seizure, as long as the FBI did not break into a person's home to complete the tapping. After Prohibition's repeal, Congress passed the Communications Act of 1934, which outlawed non-consensual phone tapping, but allowed bugging. In the 1939 case Nardone v. United States, the court ruled that due to the 1934 law, evidence the FBI obtained by phone tapping was inadmissible in court. After the 1967 case Katz v. United States overturned the 1927 case that had allowed bugging, Congress passed the Omnibus Crime Control Act, allowing public authorities to tap telephones during investigations as long as they obtain a warrant beforehand.",284,When did Hoover begin to use wiretaping to arrest bootleggers?,the 1920s,the Fourth Amendment,Congress,the Communications Act,1,"Hoover ጀሚሩ using wiretapping አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 1920s አብ እዋን Prohibition ናብ arrest .bootleggers አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 1927 ጉዳይ Olmstead .v United ,States አብ ውሽጢ አየናይ ሓደ bootlegger ኔሩ ተታሒዙ ብውሽጢ telephone ,tapping እቲ United States Supreme ቤት ፍርዲ ruled እቲ FBI wiretaps ግቡር ዘይኮነ violate እቲ Fourth Amendment ከም unlawful ምድላይ እና ,ምንፍርፋር ከም ነዊሕ ከም እቲ FBI ግቡር ዘይኮነ ስበር ናብ ውሽጢ ሓደ 'person's ገዛ ናብ ውዱእ እቲ .tapping ድሕሪ 'Prohibition's ,repeal Congress ሓሊፉ እቲ Communications ፍፃመ ካብ ,1934 አየናይ outlawed -non-consensual ስልኪ ,tapping ግን ተፈቂዱሉ .bugging አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 1939 ጉዳይ Nardone .v United ,States እቲ ቤት ፍርዲ ruled እቲ መወዳእታ ናብ እቲ 1934 ,ሕጊ ማስረጃ እቲ FBI ዝተረኸበ ብ ስልኪ tapping ኔሩ inadmissible አብ ውሽጢ .ቤት ፍርዲ ድሕሪ እቲ 1967 ጉዳይ Katz .v United States overturned እቲ 1927 ጉዳይ እቲ ዝነበረ ተፈቂዱሉ ,bugging Congress ሓሊፉ እቲ Omnibus ወንጀል ምቁጽጻር ,ፍፃመ allowing ህዝባዊ authorities ናብ ንኽእ ኣብል telephones አብ እዋን investigations ከም ነዊሕ ከም ንሶም ሓዝ ሓደ warrant .beforehand",መዓዝ ግቡር Hoover ጀምር ናብ ጥቅሚ wiretaping ናብ arrest ?bootleggers,እቲ 1920s,እቲ Fourth Amendment,Congress,እቲ Communications ፍፃመ
"In August 1836, two real estate entrepreneurs—Augustus Chapman Allen and John Kirby Allen—from New York, purchased 6,642 acres (26.88 km2) of land along Buffalo Bayou with the intent of founding a city. The Allen brothers decided to name the city after Sam Houston, the popular general at the Battle of San Jacinto, who was elected President of Texas in September 1836. The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but there were slave dealers in Houston. Thousands of enslaved African-Americans lived near the city before the Civil War. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs. In 1860 forty-nine percent of the city's population was enslaved. A few slaves, perhaps as many as 2,000 between 1835 and 1865, came through the illegal African trade. Post-war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state. They also brought or purchased enslaved African Americans, whose numbers nearly tripled in the state from 1850 to 1860, from 58,000 to 182,566.",285,When did the Allen brothers purchase land to build a city?,forty-nine percent,August 1836,"as many as 2,000",Thousands,2,"አብ ውሽጢ ነሓሰ ,1836 ክልተ ሓቂ ንብረት entrepreneurs—Augustus Chapman Allen እና John Kirby Allen—from ሓድሽ ,York purchased ,6,642 acres (.26.88 )km2 ካብ መሬት ማዕረ ኣንፈት Buffalo Bayou ምስ እቲ intent ካብ founding ሓደ .ከተማ እቲ Allen brothers ወሲነ ናብ ሽም እቲ ከተማ ድሕሪ Sam ,Houston እቲ ህቡብ ሓፈሻዊ ኣብ እቲ ውግእ ካብ San ,Jacinto መን ኔሩ elected ፕረዝደንት ካብ Texas አብ ውሽጢ መስከረም .1836 እቲ ምዑዝ መብዛሕትኡ ካብ slaves አብ ውሽጢ Texas መጺኡ ምስ ናቶም owners ካብ እቲ older ባርያ .states Sizable ,numbers ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ መጺኡ ብውሽጢ እቲ ዘቤት ባርያ .ንግዲ ሓድሽ Orleans ኔሩ እቲ ማእኸል ካብ እዚ ንግዲ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ጥሉቅ ,ደቡብ ግን ኣብቲ ኔሮም ባርያ dealers አብ ውሽጢ .Houston Thousands ካብ enslaved -African-Americans lived ጥቃ እቲ ከተማ ቅድሚ እቲ Civil .ውግእ ቡዙሕ ካብ ንሶም ጥቃ እቲ ከተማ worked አብ ልዕሊ ሽኮር እና ጡጥ ,plantations እስካብ ብጥዕሚ ካብ እቲኦም አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ከተማ limits ዝነበረ ዘቤት እና artisan .jobs አብ ውሽጢ 1860 -forty-nine percent ካብ እቲ 'city's በዝሒ ህዝቢ ኔሩ .enslaved ሓደ ቁሩብ ,slaves ምናልባት ከም ቡዙሕ ከም ,2,000 አብ መንጎ 1835 እና ,1865 መጺኡ ብውሽጢ እቲ ዘይሕጋዊ African .ንግዲ -Post-war Texas grew ብቕልጡፍ ከም migrants poured ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ ጡጥ lands ካብ እቲ .ግዝኣት ንሶም እውን ምምፃእ ወይ purchased enslaved African ,Americans ናይ መን numbers ከባቢ tripled አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ግዝኣት ካብ 1850 ናብ ,1860 ካብ ,58,000 ናብ ,.182,566",መዓዝ ግቡር እቲ Allen brothers ዓድግ መሬት ናብ ህነፅ ሓደ ?ከተማ,-forty-nine percent,ነሓሰ 1836,"ከም ቡዙሕ ከም ,2,000",Thousands
"By far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812. With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were more successful. After defeating Napoleon in 1814, Britain sent large veteran armies to invade New York, raid Washington and capture the key control of the Mississippi River at New Orleans. The New York invasion was a fiasco after the much larger British army retreated to Canada. The raiders succeeded in the burning of Washington on 25 August 1814, but were repulsed in their Chesapeake Bay Campaign at the Battle of Baltimore and the British commander killed. The major invasion in Louisiana was stopped by a one-sided military battle that killed the top three British generals and thousands of soldiers. The winners were the commanding general of the Battle of New Orleans, Major General Andrew Jackson, who became president and the Americans who basked in a victory over a much more powerful nation. The peace treaty proved successful, and the U.S. and Britain never again went to war. The losers were the Indians, who never gained the independent territory in the Midwest promised by Britain.",286,Which war was the largest military action the US engaged in during the 18th century?,Midwest,Indians,Indian,the War of 1812,4,"ብ ርሑቅ እቲ largest ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት ተግባር አብ ውሽጢ አየናይ እቲ United States ሕፁይ አብ እዋን እዚ era ኔሩ እቲ ውግእ ካብ .1812 ምስ Britain locked አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ዋና ውግእ ምስ 'Napoleon's ,France ናቱ ፖሊሲ ኔሩ ናብ ህንጻ American shipments ናብ .France እቲ United States ድሌት ናብ ምፅናሕ ግሉል እስካብ pursuing overseas .ንግዲ Britain ቁረፅ እቲ ንግዲ እና impressed seamen አብ ልዕሊ American ships ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ Royal ,Navy ብዘየገድስ ጽዑቕ .protests Britain supported ሓደ Indian insurrection አብ ውሽጢ እቲ American ,Midwest ምስ እቲ ሽቶ ካብ creating ሓደ Indian ግዝኣት ኣብቲ እቲ ይኸውን ህንጻ American .expansion እቲ United States ኣብ መወዳእታ declared ውግእ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ United Kingdom አብ ውሽጢ ,1812 እቲ መጀመርታ ግዜ እቲ ..U.S ዝነበረ officially declared .ውግእ ዘይኮነ hopeful ካብ defeating እቲ Royal ,Navy እቲ ..U.S attacked እቲ British Empire ብ invading British ,Canada hoping ናብ ጥቅሚ captured ግዝኣት ከም ሓደ bargaining .chip እቲ invasion ካብ Canada ኔሩ ሓደ ,debacle እኳ concurrent wars ምስ መበቆል Americans አብ ልዕሊ እቲ western ቅድሚት ('Tecumseh's ውግእ እና እቲ Creek )ውግእ ኔሮም ቡዙሕ .ዕውት ድሕሪ defeating Napoleon አብ ውሽጢ ,1814 Britain ተላኢኹ ገዚፍ veteran armies ናብ invade ሓድሽ ,York raid Washington እና ምሓዝ እቲ መፍትሕ ምቁጽጻር ካብ እቲ Mississippi ሩባ ኣብ ሓድሽ .Orleans እቲ ሓድሽ York invasion ኔሩ ሓደ fiasco ድሕሪ እቲ ብዙሕ larger British ሰራዊት retreated ናብ .Canada እቲ raiders succeeded አብ ውሽጢ እቲ burning ካብ Washington አብ ልዕሊ 25 ነሓሰ ,1814 ግን ኔሮም repulsed አብ ውሽጢ ናቶም Chesapeake ልሳን ባሕሪ ወፍሪ ኣብ እቲ ውግእ ካብ Baltimore እና እቲ British commander .killed እቲ ዋና invasion አብ ውሽጢ Louisiana ኔሩ stopped ብ ሓደ -one-sided ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት ውግእ እቲ killed እቲ ላዕለዋይ ሰለስተ British generals እና thousands ካብ .soldiers እቲ winners ኔሮም እቲ commanding ሓፈሻዊ ካብ እቲ ውግእ ካብ ሓድሽ ,Orleans ዋና ሓፈሻዊ Andrew ,Jackson መን ኮይኑ ፕረዝደንት እና እቲ Americans መን basked አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ victory ልዕሊ ሓደ ብዙሕ ቡዙሕ ሓያል .nation እቲ ሰላም treaty proved ,ዕውት እና እቲ ..U.S እና Britain ፍፁም ካልኣይ ኬዱ ናብ .ውግእ እቲ losers ኔሮም እቲ ,Indians መን ፍፁም gained እቲ ዓርሱ ዝኸኣለ ግዝኣት አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Midwest promised ብ .Britain",አየናይ ውግእ ኔሩ እቲ largest ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት ተግባር እቲ ንሕና ሕፁይ አብ ውሽጢ አብ እዋን እቲ 18th ?ዘመን,Midwest,Indians,Indian,እቲ ውግእ ካብ 1812

"In the human digestive system, food enters the mouth and mechanical digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work. After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes.",292,What contains the liquid that gets wet?,pepsin,two,Gastric,Saliva,4,"አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ሰብ digestive ,ስርዓት ምግቢ enters እቲ ኣፍ እና mechanical digestion ካብ እቲ ምግቢ starts ብ እቲ ተግባር ካብ mastication (),chewing ሓደ ፎርም ካብ mechanical ,digestion እና እቲ wetting መርከቢ ካብ .saliva ,Saliva ሓደ ፈሳሲ secreted ብ እቲ salivary ,glands የጠቓልል salivary ,amylase ሓደ enzyme አየናይ starts እቲ digestion ካብ starch አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ;ምግቢ እቲ saliva እውን የጠቓልል ,mucus አየናይ lubricates እቲ ,ምግቢ እና hydrogen ,carbonate አየናይ provides እቲ ተስማዕማዒ ኩነታት ካብ pH ()alkaline ን amylase ናብ .ስራሕ ድሕሪ undergoing mastication እና starch ,digestion እቲ ምግቢ ንመፃእ ኩን አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ፎርም ካብ ሓደ ,ንኡስ ዓንኬል slurry መጠን ኣካል ዝተፀወዐ ሓደ .bolus እቲ ነገር ንመፃእ ሽዑ ምጉዓዝ ታሕቲ እቲ esophagus እና ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ ከብዲ ብ እቲ ተግባር ካብ .peristalsis Gastric ጽሟቕ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ከብዲ starts protein .digestion Gastric ጽሟቕ mainly የጠቓልል hydrochloric acid እና .pepsin ከም እዚ ክልተ chemicals ተዝኸዉን ጉድኣት እቲ ከብዲ ,መንደቅ mucus እዩ secreted ብ እቲ ,ከብዲ providing ሓደ slimy ሽፋን እቲ acts ከም ሓደ ዋልታ ተቃራኒ እቲ damaging effects ካብ እቲ .chemicals ኣብ እቲ ማዕረ ግዜ protein digestion እዩ ,occurring mechanical mixing ኮነ ብ ,peristalsis አየናይ እዩ waves ካብ muscular contractions እቲ ምንቅስቓስ ማዕረ ኣንፈት እቲ ከብዲ .መንደቅ እዚ allows እቲ መጠን ኣካል ካብ ምግቢ ናብ ርሑቅ mix ምስ እቲ digestive .enzymes",እንታይ የጠቓልል እቲ ፈሳሲ እቲ gets ?ርሑስ,pepsin,ክልተ,Gastric,Saliva
"Despite the large number of philosophical schools and subtle nuances between many, all philosophies are said to fall into one of two primary categories, which are defined in contrast to each other: Idealism, and materialism.[a] The basic proposition of these two categories pertains to the nature of reality, and the primary distinction between them is the way they answer two fundamental questions: ""what does reality consist of?"" and ""how does it originate?""

"Between the 8th and 18th centuries, the use of glazed ceramics was prevalent in Islamic art, usually assuming the form of elaborate pottery. Tin-opacified glazing was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters. The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in Basra, dating to around the 8th century. Another contribution was the development of stone-paste ceramics, originating from 9th century Iraq.

"Gellius says that in his day humanitas is commonly used as a synonym for philanthropy – or kindness and benevolence toward one's fellow human being. Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean what we might call ""humane"" or ""polite"" learning, or the Greek equivalent Paideia. Gellius became a favorite author in the Italian Renaissance, and, in fifteenth-century Italy, teachers and scholars of philosophy, poetry, and rhetoric were called and called themselves ""humanists"". Modern scholars, however, point out that Cicero (106 – 43 BCE), who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term humanitas, in fact frequently used the word in both senses, as did his near contemporaries. For Cicero, a lawyer, what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech, which, allied to reason, could (and should) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law. Thus humanitas included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative, humanism, which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to scholarship.",297,Who says that humanitas is often a synonym for philanthropy?,Gellius,today,43,two,1,"Gellius says እቲ አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ መዓልቲ humanitas እዩ commonly ዘገልገለ ከም ሓደ synonym ን philanthropy – ወይ ለዋሃነት እና benevolence ንቕድሚት 'one's ተኸታሊ ሰብ .ፍጥረት Gellius maintains እቲ እዚ ልሙድ usage እዩ ,ጌጋ እና እቲ መርኣያ writers ካብ ,Latin ከምዚ ከም Cicero እና ,others ዘገልገለ እቲ ቃል ጥራሕ ናብ ማለት እንታይ ንሕና ይኸዉን ደውል """"humane ወይ """"ክብሪ ብዘለዎ ,ምምሃር ወይ እቲ Greek ዝመዓራረ .Paideia Gellius ኮይኑ ሓደ ዝፍተው ጸሓፊ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Italian ,Renaissance ,እና አብ ውሽጢ -fifteenth-century ,Italy teachers እና scholars ካብ ,ፍልስፍና ,ግጥሚ እና rhetoric ኔሮም ዝተፀወዐ እና ዝተፀወዐ ባዕሎም """".humanists ዘበናዊ ,scholars ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ነጥቢ ደገ እቲ Cicero (106 – 43 ),BCE መን ኔሩ ብጥዕሚ ሓላፍነት ዝወስድ ን defining እና popularizing እቲ ቃል ,humanitas አብ ውሽጢ ሓቂ ብተደጋጋሚ ዘገልገለ እቲ ቃል አብ ውሽጢ ክልቲኡ ,senses ከም ግቡር ናቱ ጥቃ .contemporaries ን ,Cicero ሓደ ,ጠበቃ እንታይ ብጥዕሚ distinguished humans ካብ brutes ኔሩ ,ዘረባ ,አየናይ allied ናብ ,ምኽንያት ይከኣል (እና )ይሓይሽ ኣኽእል ንሶም ናብ ተስማዕመዐ disputes እና ንበር ብሓባር አብ ውሽጢ concord እና ስኒት ትሕቲ እቲ ስርዓት ካብ .ሕጊ ስለዝኾነ humanitas included ክልተ meanings ካብ እቲ outset እና እዚ ቀፃሊ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ዘበናዊ ,derivative ,humanism አየናይ ሙሉእ ሎምዓንቲ ይኽእል ምራሕ ናብ ክልቲኡ humanitarian benevolence እና ናብ .scholarship",መን says እቲ humanitas እዩ ኩል ግዘ ሓደ synonym ን ?philanthropy,Gellius,ሎምዓንቲ,43,ክልተ

"The cultivation of the domesticated grape began 6,000–8,000 years ago in the Near East. Yeast, one of the earliest domesticated microorganisms, occurs naturally on the skins of grapes, leading to the innovation of alcoholic drinks such as wine. The earliest archeological evidence for a dominant position of wine-making in human culture dates from 8,000 years ago in Georgia. The oldest winery was found in Armenia, dating to around 4000 BC.[citation needed] By the 9th century AD the city of Shiraz was known to produce some of the finest wines in the Middle East. Thus it has been proposed that Syrah red wine is named after Shiraz, a city in Persia where the grape was used to make Shirazi wine.[citation needed] Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics record the cultivation of purple grapes,[citation needed] and history attests to the ancient Greeks, Phoenicians, and Romans growing purple grapes for both eating and wine production[citation needed].

The body position is maintained while ""punching"" (blocking using only a shoulder movement) the vaulting platform. The gymnast then rotates to a standing position. In advanced gymnastics, multiple twists and somersaults may be added before landing.

Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The Moon formed soon afterwards, possibly as the result of a Mars-sized object with about 10% of the Earth's mass impacting the planet in a glancing blow. Some of this object's mass merged with the Earth, significantly altering its internal composition, and a portion was ejected into space. Some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon.

"The origins of the HDI are found in the annual Development Reports of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). These were devised and launched by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq in 1990 and had the explicit purpose ""to shift the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people-centered policies"". To produce the Human Development Reports, Mahbub ul Haq formed a group of development economists including Paul Streeten, Frances Stewart, Gustav Ranis, Keith Griffin, Sudhir Anand, and Meghnad Desai. Working alongside Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, they worked on capabilities and functions that provided the underlying conceptual framework. Haq was sure that a simple composite measure of human development was needed in order to convince the public, academics, and politicians that they can and should evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well-being. Sen initially opposed this idea, but he soon went on to help Haq develop the Index. Sen was worried that it was going to be difficult to capture the full complexity of human capabilities in a single index, but Haq persuaded him that only a single number would shift the immediate attention of politicians from economic to human well-being.",314,In what year did the HDI come about?,the Human Development Reports,Mahbub,1990,Amartya Sen,3,"እቲ origins ካብ እቲ HDI እዮም ተረኺቡ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ዓመታዊ ዕብየት Reports ካብ እቲ United Nations ዕብየት Programme ().UNDP እዚ ኔሮም devised እና launched ብ Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq አብ ውሽጢ 1990 እና ዝነበረ እቲ explicit ዕላማ ""ናብ ምቕያር እቲ ቀልቢ ምግባር ካብ ዕብየት economics ካብ ሃገራዊ ኣታዊ accounting ናብ -people-centered "".policies ናብ ምፍራይ እቲ ሰብ ዕብየት ,Reports Mahbub ul Haq formed ሓደ ጉጅለ ካብ ዕብየት economists ይሓውስ Paul ,Streeten Frances ,Stewart Gustav ,Ranis Keith ,Griffin Sudhir ,Anand እና Meghnad .Desai ምስራሕ alongside Nobel laureate Amartya ,Sen ንሶም worked አብ ልዕሊ capabilities እና functions እቲ ተዳልዩ እቲ underlying conceptual .ምስሊ Haq ኔሩ እርግፀኛ እቲ ሓደ ቀሊል composite ለክዕ ካብ ሰብ ዕብየት ኔሩ needed አብ ውሽጢ ስርዓት ናብ ኣእምን እቲ ,ህዝባዊ ,academics እና politicians እቲ ንሶም ይኽእል እና ይሓይሽ ገምግም ዕብየት ዘይኮነ ጥራሕ ብ ቁጠባዊ advances ግን እውን improvements አብ ውሽጢ ሰብ -.well-being Sen initially opposed እዚ ,ሓሳብ ግን ንሱ አብ ቀረባ ኬዱ አብ ልዕሊ ናብ ሓገዝ Haq ዕበ እቲ .Index Sen ኔሩ ጭኑቕ እቲ እቲ ነገር ኔሩ ከያዲ ናብ ኩን ከቢድ ናብ ምሓዝ እቲ ሙሉእ complexity ካብ ሰብ capabilities አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ነፀላ ,index ግን Haq persuaded ንሱ እቲ ጥራሕ ሓደ ነፀላ ቑጽሪ ይኸውን ምቕያር እቲ ሽዕ ንሻዕ ቀልቢ ካብ politicians ካብ ቁጠባዊ ናብ ሰብ -.well-being",አብ ውሽጢ እንታይ ዓመት ግቡር እቲ HDI ንዓ ?ብዝዕባ,እቲ ሰብ ዕብየት Reports,Mahbub,1990,Amartya Sen

Anglicanism is sometimes considered to be independent from Protestantism.[b] The term derives from the letter of protestation from Lutheran princes in 1529 against an edict condemning the teachings of Martin Luther as heretical.",317,What is Protestantism a form of Christian faith and practice?,1529,"the Protestant Reformation,[a",Eastern Orthodoxy,three,2,"Protestantism እዩ ሓደ ፎርም ካብ Christian እምነት እና ትግበራ አየናይ originated ምስ እቲ Protestant ,[]Reformation,[a ሓደ ምንቅስቓስ ተቃራኒ እንታይ ናቱ followers ገምገመ ናብ ኩን errors አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Roman Catholic .ቤተ ክርስትያን እቲ ነገር እዩ ሓደ ካብ እቲ ሰለስተ ዋና divisions ካብ ,Christendom ብሓባር ምስ Roman Catholicism እና Eastern .Orthodoxy Anglicanism እዩ ሓደ ሓደ ግዘ ገምገመ ናብ ኩን ዓርሱ ዝኸኣለ ካብ .[]Protestantism.[b እቲ ቃል derives ካብ እቲ ደብዳበ ካብ protestation ካብ Lutheran princes አብ ውሽጢ 1529 ተቃራኒ ሓደ edict condemning እቲ teachings ካብ Martin Luther ከም .heretical",እንታይ እዩ Protestantism ሓደ ፎርም ካብ Christian እምነት እና ?ትግበራ,1529,"እቲ Protestant ,[Reformation,[a",Eastern Orthodoxy,ሰለስተ
"The coastal plain transitions to the Piedmont region along the Atlantic Seaboard fall line, a line which marks the elevation at which waterfalls first appear on streams and rivers. The Piedmont region of central North Carolina is the state's most urbanized and densely populated section. It consists of gently rolling countryside frequently broken by hills or low mountain ridges. Small, isolated, and deeply eroded mountain ranges and peaks are located in the Piedmont, including the Sauratown Mountains, Pilot Mountain, the Uwharrie Mountains, Crowder's Mountain, King's Pinnacle, the Brushy Mountains, and the South Mountains. The Piedmont ranges from about 300 to 400 feet (91 to 122 m) in elevation in the east to over 1,000 feet (300 m) in the west. Because of the rapid population growth in the Piedmont, a significant part of the rural area in this region is being transformed into suburbs with shopping centers, housing, and corporate offices. Agriculture is steadily declining in importance.

"Vacuum is space void of matter. The word stems from the Latin adjective vacuus for ""vacant"" or ""void"". An approximation to such vacuum is a region with a gaseous pressure much less than atmospheric pressure. Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum, which they sometimes simply call ""vacuum"" or free space, and use the term partial vacuum to refer to an actual imperfect vacuum as one might have in a laboratory or in space. In engineering and applied physics on the other hand, vacuum refers to any space in which the pressure is lower than atmospheric pressure. The Latin term in vacuo is used to describe an object as being in what would otherwise be a vacuum.",319,What is space void of matter?,Latin,hoover.n.04,vacuo,Vacuum,4,"ህዋ እዩ ቦታ ባዶ ካብ .ነገር እቲ ቃል stems ካብ እቲ Latin ገላጺ vacuus ን """"vacant ወይ """".ባዶ ሓደ approximation ናብ ከምዚ ህዋ እዩ ሓደ ክልል ምስ ሓደ gaseous ፀቅጢ ብዙሕ ዝወሓደ ካብ atmospheric .ፀቅጢ Physicists ኩል ግዘ ተመያየጡ ተስማዕማዒ ፈተና ውፅኢታት እቲ ይኸውን ይፍፀም አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ፍፁም ,ህዋ አየናይ ንሶም ሓደ ሓደ ግዘ simply ደውል """"ህዋ ወይ ነፃ ,ቦታ እና ጥቅሚ እቲ ቃል partial ህዋ ናብ ምራሕ ናብ ሓደ ክዉን imperfect ህዋ ከም ሓደ ይኸዉን ኣለኒ አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ laboratory ወይ አብ ውሽጢ .ቦታ አብ ውሽጢ engineering እና applied physics አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ካልእ ,ኢድ ህዋ refers ናብ ዝኾነ ቦታ አብ ውሽጢ አየናይ እቲ ፀቅጢ እዩ ታሕተዋይ ካብ atmospheric .ፀቅጢ እቲ Latin ቃል አብ ውሽጢ vacuo እዩ ዘገልገለ ናብ ግለፅ ሓደ ግኡዝ ነገር ከም ፍጥረት አብ ውሽጢ እንታይ ይኸውን ተዘይኮይኑ ግን ኩን ሓደ .ህዋ",እንታይ እዩ ቦታ ባዶ ካብ ?ነገር,Latin,..hoover.n.04,vacuo,ህዋ

"Although there is some evidence of earlier inhabitation in the region of Utrecht, dating back to the Stone Age (app. 2200 BCE) and settling in the Bronze Age (app. 1800–800 BCE), the founding date of the city is usually related to the construction of a Roman fortification (castellum), probably built in around 50 CE. A series of such fortresses was built after the Roman emperor Claudius decided the empire should not expand north. To consolidate the border the limes Germanicus defense line was constructed  along the main branch of the river Rhine, which at that time flowed through a more northern bed compared to today (what is now the Kromme Rijn).

Al-Razi and Al-Farabi had provided methodology and knowledge in medicine and philosophy. Avicenna had access to the great libraries of Balkh, Khwarezm, Gorgan, Rey, Isfahan and Hamadan. Various texts (such as the 'Ahd with Bahmanyar) show that he debated philosophical points with the greatest scholars of the time.

This created an association called the Labour Representation Committee (LRC), meant to coordinate attempts to support MPs sponsored by trade unions and represent the working-class population. It had no single leader, and in the absence of one, the Independent Labour Party nominee Ramsay MacDonald was elected as Secretary. He had the difficult task of keeping the various strands of opinions in the LRC united.

"The Labour Party's origins lie in the late 19th century, when it became apparent that there was a need for a new political party to represent the interests and needs of the urban proletariat, a demographic which had increased in number and had recently been given franchise. Some members of the trades union movement became interested in moving into the political field, and after further extensions of the voting franchise in 1867 and 1885, the Liberal Party endorsed some trade-union sponsored candidates. The first Lib–Lab candidate to stand was George Odger in the Southwark by-election of 1870. In addition, several small socialist groups had formed around this time, with the intention of linking the movement to political policies.

Peters, alleged that Boutris said he attempted to ground Southwest after finding cracks in the fuselage, but was prevented by supervisors he said were friendly with the airline.

Audits of other airlines resulted in two airlines grounding hundreds of planes, causing thousands of flight cancellations. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held hearings in April 2008. Jim Oberstar, former chairman of the committee said its investigation uncovered a pattern of regulatory abuse and widespread regulatory lapses, allowing 117 aircraft to be operated commercially although not in compliance with FAA safety rules. Oberstar said there was a ""culture of coziness"" between senior FAA officials and the airlines and ""a systematic breakdown"" in the FAA's culture that resulted in ""malfeasance, bordering on corruption."" In 2008 the FAA proposed to fine Southwest $10.2 million for failing to inspect older planes for cracks, and in 2009 Southwest and the FAA agreed that Southwest would pay a $7.5 million penalty and would adopt new safety procedures, with the fine doubling if Southwest failed to follow through.",345,How many planes were overdue for inspections?,Jim Oberstar,Boutris,FAA,46,4,"አብ ውሽጢ ,2007 ክልተ FAA ,whistleblowers inspectors Charalambe """"Bobby Boutris እና Douglas .E ,Peters alleged እቲ Boutris ኢሉ ንሱ attempted ናብ ምድሪ Southwest ድሕሪ finding cracks አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ,fuselage ግን ኔሩ prevented ብ supervisors ንሱ ኢሉ ኔሮም ምቕሉል ምስ እቲ .airline እዚ ኔሩ validated ብ ሓደ ኣፍልጥ ብ እቲ ክፍሊ ካብ መጓዓዝያ አየናይ ተረኺቡ FAA managers ዝነበረ ተፈቂዱሉ Southwest Airlines ናብ ንፈር 46 airplanes አብ ውሽጢ 2006 እና 2007 እቲ ኔሮም overdue ን ድሕንነት ,inspections ignoring concerns ተሰአ ብ .inspectors Audits ካብ ካልእ airlines resulted አብ ውሽጢ ክልተ airlines grounding hundreds ካብ ,planes causing thousands ካብ በረራ .cancellations እቲ ገዛ መጓዓዝያ እና Infrastructure Committee ተገይሩ hearings አብ ውሽጢ ጉንበት .2008 Jim ,Oberstar ናይ ቀደም chairman ካብ እቲ committee ኢሉ ናቱ investigation uncovered ሓደ ንድፊ ካብ regulatory ፀረፈ እና widespread regulatory ,lapses allowing 117 aircraft ናብ ኩን operated commercially ዋላ እኳ ዘይኮነ አብ ውሽጢ ምእዙዝነት ምስ FAA ድሕንነት .ስርዓታት Oberstar ኢሉ ኣብቲ ኔሩ ሓደ ""ባህሊ ካብ ""coziness አብ መንጎ ላዕለዋይ FAA officials እና እቲ airlines እና ""ሓደ systematic ""breakdown አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 'FAA's ባህሊ እቲ resulted አብ ውሽጢ "",malfeasance bordering አብ ልዕሊ .""corruption አብ ውሽጢ 2008 እቲ FAA proposed ናብ ደሓን Southwest $.10.2 ሚልዮን ን failing ናብ inspect older planes ን ,cracks እና አብ ውሽጢ 2009 Southwest እና እቲ FAA agreed እቲ Southwest ይኸውን ክፈል ሓደ $.7.5 ሚልዮን penalty እና ይኸውን ተቐባልነት ሓድሽ ድሕንነት ,procedures ምስ እቲ ደሓን doubling እንተ Southwest ወዲቑ ናብ ተኸተል .ብውሽጢ",ከመይ ቡዙሕ planes ኔሮም overdue ን ?inspections,Jim Oberstar,Boutris,FAA,46
"In physics, energy is a property of objects which can be transferred to other objects or converted into different forms. The ""ability of a system to perform work"" is a common description, but it is difficult to give one single comprehensive definition of energy because of its many forms. For instance, in SI units, energy is measured in joules, and one joule is defined ""mechanically"", being the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.[note 1] However, there are many other definitions of energy, depending on the context, such as thermal energy, radiant energy, electromagnetic, nuclear, etc., where definitions are derived that are the most convenient.",346,"How many joules are ""mechanically"" defined in physics?",one,singleton.n.01,monad.n.02,SI,1,"አብ ውሽጢ ,physics ጉልበት እዩ ሓደ ንብረት ካብ objects አየናይ ይኽእል ኩን transferred ናብ ካልእ objects ወይ converted ናብ ውሽጢ ፍሉይ .forms እቲ ""ተኽእሎ ካብ ሓደ ስርዓት ናብ ግበር ""ስራሕ እዩ ሓደ ልሙድ ,መግለፂ ግን እቲ ነገር እዩ ከቢድ ናብ ሃብ ሓደ ነፀላ ኣጠቓላሊ ኣገላልፃ ካብ ጉልበት ምኽንያቱ ካብ ናቱ ቡዙሕ .forms ን ,ኣብነት አብ ውሽጢ SI ,units ጉልበት እዩ measured አብ ውሽጢ ,joules እና ሓደ joule እዩ defined """",mechanically ፍጥረት እቲ ጉልበት transferred ናብ ሓደ ግኡዝ ነገር ብ እቲ mechanical ስራሕ ካብ moving እቲ ነገር ሓደ ርሕቐት ካብ 1 metre ተቃራኒ ሓደ ሓይሊ ካብ 1 .[newton.[note ]1 ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ኣብቲ እዮም ቡዙሕ ካልእ definitions ካብ ,ጉልበት depending አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ,ዓውዲ ከምዚ ከም thermal ,ጉልበት radiant ,ጉልበት ,electromagnetic ,nuclear .,ወዘተ አበይ definitions እዮም derived እቲ እዮም እቲ ብጥዕሚ .ምችው","ከመይ ቡዙሕ joules እዮም """"mechanically defined አብ ውሽጢ ?physics",ሓደ,..singleton.n.01,..monad.n.02,SI
"Copper occurs naturally as native copper and was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record. It has a history of use that is at least 10,000 years old, and estimates of its discovery place it at 9000 BC in the Middle East; a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC. There is evidence that gold and meteoric iron (but not iron smelting) were the only metals used by humans before copper. The history of copper metallurgy is thought to have followed the following sequence: 1) cold working of native copper, 2) annealing, 3) smelting, and 4) the lost wax method. In southeastern Anatolia, all four of these metallurgical techniques appears more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic c. 7500 BC. However, just as agriculture was independently invented in several parts of the world, copper smelting was invented locally in several different places. It was probably discovered independently in China before 2800 BC, in Central America perhaps around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting was invented in 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK at 2280 to 1890 BC. Ötzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300–3200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest his involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led to the discovery of iron smelting. Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.[citation needed]",347,How old is the copper pendant thought to be?,8700,China,four,Michigan,1,"ነሓስ ኮነ naturally ከም መበቆል ነሓስ እና ኔሩ ፍሉጥ ናብ ንእሽተይ ካብ እቲ oldest civilizations አብ ልዕሊ .ቅዳሕ እቲ ነገር ኣለዎ ሓደ ታሪኽ ካብ ጥቅሚ እቲ እዩ ኣብ ዝነኣሰ ,10,000 ዓመታት ,ዓብይ እና estimates ካብ ናቱ discovery ቦታ እቲ ነገር ኣብ 9000 BC አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ማእኸል ;ምብራቅ ሓደ ነሓስ pendant ኔሩ ተረኺቡ አብ ውሽጢ northern Iraq እቲ dates ናብ 8700 .BC ኣብቲ እዩ ማስረጃ እቲ ወርቂ እና meteoric ሓፂን (ግን ዘይኮነ ሓፂን )smelting ኔሮም እቲ ጥራሕ metals ዘገልገለ ብ humans ቅድሚ .ነሓስ እቲ ታሪኽ ካብ ነሓስ metallurgy እዩ ሓሳብ ናብ ኣለኒ followed እቲ ምኽታል :ቕደም ስዓብ )1 ቁሪ ምስራሕ ካብ መበቆል ,ነሓስ )2 ,annealing )3 ,smelting እና )4 እቲ ዝጠፈአ wax .ሜላ አብ ውሽጢ southeastern ,Anatolia ኩሎም ዓርባዕተ ካብ እዚ metallurgical techniques appears ቡዙሕ ወይ ዝወሓደ ብተኻታታሊ ኣብ እቲ መጀመርታ ካብ እቲ Neolithic .c 7500 .BC ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ጥራሕ ከም ግብርና ኔሩ independently invented አብ ውሽጢ ቡዙሓት parts ካብ እቲ ,ዓለም ነሓስ smelting ኔሩ invented locally አብ ውሽጢ ቡዙሓት ፍሉይ .ቦታታት እቲ ነገር ኔሩ ናይ ምዃን ዕድል discovered independently አብ ውሽጢ China ቅድሚ 2800 ,BC አብ ውሽጢ Central America ምናልባት አብ ከባቢ 600 ,AD እና አብ ውሽጢ ምዕራብ Africa ብዝዕባ እቲ 9th ወይ 10th ዘመን .AD Investment casting ኔሩ invented አብ ውሽጢ 4500–4000 BC አብ ውሽጢ Southeast Asia እና carbon dating ኣለዎ ዝተመስረተ mining ኣብ Alderley ጫፍ አብ ውሽጢ ,Cheshire UK ኣብ 2280 ናብ 1890 .BC Ötzi እቲ ,Iceman ሓደ ተባዕታይ dated ካብ 3300–3200 ,BC ኔሩ ተረኺቡ ምስ ሓደ axe ምስ ሓደ ነሓስ ርእሲ .%99.7 ;ፅሩይ ላዕሊ levels ካብ arsenic አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ ፀጉሪ ሓሳብ ምቕራብ ናቱ involvement አብ ውሽጢ ነሓስ .smelting ተሞክሮ ምስ ነሓስ ኣለዎ assisted እቲ ዕብየት ካብ ካልእ ;metals አብ ውሽጢ ,ብፍሉይ ነሓስ smelting መረሐ ናብ እቲ discovery ካብ ሓፂን .smelting ምህርቲ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ዓብይ ነሓስ ሕውስዋስ አብ ውሽጢ Michigan እና Wisconsin እዩ dated አብ መንጎ 6000 እና 3000 .BC ተፈጥራዊ ,bronze ሓደ ዓይነት ካብ ነሓስ ዝተሰርሐ ካብ ores ሓፍታም አብ ውሽጢ ,silicon ,arsenic እና ()ሓልሓሊፉ ,tin መጺኡ ናብ ውሽጢ ሓፈሻዊ ጥቅሚ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Balkans አብ ከባቢ 5500 .[BC.[citation ]needed",ከመይ ዓብይ እዩ እቲ ነሓስ pendant ሓሳብ ናብ ?ኩን,8700,China,ዓርባዕተ,Michigan

"Gellius says that in his day humanitas is commonly used as a synonym for philanthropy – or kindness and benevolence toward one's fellow human being. Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean what we might call ""humane"" or ""polite"" learning, or the Greek equivalent Paideia. Gellius became a favorite author in the Italian Renaissance, and, in fifteenth-century Italy, teachers and scholars of philosophy, poetry, and rhetoric were called and called themselves ""humanists"". Modern scholars, however, point out that Cicero (106 – 43 BCE), who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term humanitas, in fact frequently used the word in both senses, as did his near contemporaries. For Cicero, a lawyer, what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech, which, allied to reason, could (and should) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law. Thus humanitas included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative, humanism, which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to scholarship.",353,Who maintains that the common usage of humanitas is wrong?,43,Gellius,two,today,2,"Gellius says እቲ አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ መዓልቲ humanitas እዩ commonly ዘገልገለ ከም ሓደ synonym ን philanthropy – ወይ ለዋሃነት እና benevolence ንቕድሚት 'one's ተኸታሊ ሰብ .ፍጥረት Gellius maintains እቲ እዚ ልሙድ usage እዩ ,ጌጋ እና እቲ መርኣያ writers ካብ ,Latin ከምዚ ከም Cicero እና ,others ዘገልገለ እቲ ቃል ጥራሕ ናብ ማለት እንታይ ንሕና ይኸዉን ደውል """"humane ወይ """"ክብሪ ብዘለዎ ,ምምሃር ወይ እቲ Greek ዝመዓራረ .Paideia Gellius ኮይኑ ሓደ ዝፍተው ጸሓፊ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Italian ,Renaissance ,እና አብ ውሽጢ -fifteenth-century ,Italy teachers እና scholars ካብ ,ፍልስፍና ,ግጥሚ እና rhetoric ኔሮም ዝተፀወዐ እና ዝተፀወዐ ባዕሎም """".humanists ዘበናዊ ,scholars ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ነጥቢ ደገ እቲ Cicero (106 – 43 ),BCE መን ኔሩ ብጥዕሚ ሓላፍነት ዝወስድ ን defining እና popularizing እቲ ቃል ,humanitas አብ ውሽጢ ሓቂ ብተደጋጋሚ ዘገልገለ እቲ ቃል አብ ውሽጢ ክልቲኡ ,senses ከም ግቡር ናቱ ጥቃ .contemporaries ን ,Cicero ሓደ ,ጠበቃ እንታይ ብጥዕሚ distinguished humans ካብ brutes ኔሩ ,ዘረባ ,አየናይ allied ናብ ,ምኽንያት ይከኣል (እና )ይሓይሽ ኣኽእል ንሶም ናብ ተስማዕመዐ disputes እና ንበር ብሓባር አብ ውሽጢ concord እና ስኒት ትሕቲ እቲ ስርዓት ካብ .ሕጊ ስለዝኾነ humanitas included ክልተ meanings ካብ እቲ outset እና እዚ ቀፃሊ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ዘበናዊ ,derivative ,humanism አየናይ ሙሉእ ሎምዓንቲ ይኽእል ምራሕ ናብ ክልቲኡ humanitarian benevolence እና ናብ .scholarship",መን maintains እቲ እቲ ልሙድ usage ካብ humanitas እዩ ?ጌጋ,43,Gellius,ክልተ,ሎምዓንቲ

"The term Hokkien (福建; hɔk˥˥kɪɛn˨˩) is itself a term not used in Chinese to refer to the dialect, as it simply means Fujian province. In Chinese linguistics, these dialects are known by their classification under the Quanzhang Division (Chinese: 泉漳片; pinyin: Quánzhāng piàn) of Min Nan, which comes from the first characters of the two main Hokkien urban centers Quanzhou and Zhangzhou.

"The phonograph disc record was the primary medium used for music reproduction until late in the 20th century, replacing the phonograph cylinder record–with which it had co-existed from the late 1880s through to the 1920s–by the late 1920s. Records retained the largest market share even when new formats such as compact cassette were mass-marketed. By the late 1980s, digital media, in the form of the compact disc, had gained a larger market share, and the vinyl record left the mainstream in 1991. From the 1990s to the 2010s, records continued to be manufactured and sold on a much smaller scale, and were especially used by disc jockeys (DJ)s, released by artists in some genres, and listened to by a niche market of audiophiles. The phonograph record has made a niche resurgence in the early 21st century – 9.2 million records were sold in the U.S. in 2014, a 260% increase since 2009.

"A capacitor (originally known as a condenser) is a passive two-terminal electrical component used to store electrical energy temporarily in an electric field. The forms of practical capacitors vary widely, but all contain at least two electrical conductors (plates) separated by a dielectric (i.e. an insulator that can store energy by becoming polarized). The conductors can be thin films, foils or sintered beads of metal or conductive electrolyte, etc. The nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity. Materials commonly used as dielectrics include glass, ceramic, plastic film, air, vacuum, paper, mica, and oxide layers. Capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices. Unlike a resistor, an ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy.

"Puberty occurs through a long process and begins with a surge in hormone production, which in turn causes a number of physical changes. It is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics (for example, a deeper voice and larger adam's apple in boys, and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the pituitary gland, which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction to occur. The male and female gonads are subsequently activated, which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals. The testes primarily release testosterone, and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen. The production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met.

"In an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material (detritus)). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the ""donor"" organism(s).",364,What is an interaction where predators feed on their prey?,—,predation,—,—,2,"አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ,ecosystem predation እዩ ሓደ biological ምትሕብባር አበይ ሓደ predator (ሓደ organism እቲ እዩ )hunting feeds አብ ልዕሊ ናቱ ግዳይ (እቲ organism እቲ እዩ ).attacked Predators ተዝኸዉን ወይ ተዝኸዉን ዘይኮነ ምቕታል ናቶም ግዳይ ቅድሚያ ናብ feeding አብ ልዕሊ ,ንሶም ግን እቲ ፍፃመ ካብ predation ኩል ግዘ ውፅኢታት አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ሞት ካብ እቲ ግዳይ እና እቲ eventual absorption ካብ እቲ 'prey's ቲሹ ብውሽጢ .ምህላኽ ስለዝኾነ predation እዩ ,ኩል ግዘ እኳ ዘይኮነ ,ወትሪ .carnivory ካልእ categories ካብ ምህላኽ እዮም herbivory (ምብላዕ parts ካብ ),ተኽልታት fungivory (ምብላዕ parts ካብ ),fungi እና detritivory (እቲ ምህላኽ ካብ ምውት organic ናውቲ ()).detritus ኩሎም እዚ ምህላኽ categories ምውዳቅ ትሕቲ እቲ rubric ካብ -consumer-resource .systems እቲ ነገር ይኽእል ኩል ግዘ ኩን ከቢድ ናብ ፍለ ዝተፈላለዩ types ካብ feeding .behaviors ን ,ኣብነት ንእሽተይ parasitic ዓሌታት ግዳይ አብ ልዕሊ ሓደ መዳለዊ organism እና ሽዑ ምውዳቕ ናቶም eggs አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ነገር ን ናቶም offspring ናብ ምምጋብ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ነገር እስካብ እቲ ነገር continues ናብ ንበር አብ ውሽጢ ወይ አብ ልዕሊ ናቱ decaying corpse ድሕሪ እቲ ነገር ኣለዎ .ሞይቱ እቲ መፍትሕ characteristic ካብ predation ዋላኳ ተኾነ እዩ እቲ 'predator's ቕጥታ ፅልዋ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ግዳይ .በዝሒ ህዝቢ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ካልእ ,ኢድ detritivores simply ብላዕ ምውት organic ናውቲ arising ካብ እቲ ሙሽሙሽ ካብ ምውት individuals እና ኣለኒ አይኮንን ቕጥታ ፅልዋ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ """"donor ().organism(s",እንታይ እዩ ሓደ ምትሕብባር አበይ predators ምምጋብ አብ ልዕሊ ናቶም ?ግዳይ,—,predation,—,—

"There are typically 40 million bacterial cells in a gram of soil and a million bacterial cells in a millilitre of fresh water. There are approximately 5×1030 bacteria on Earth, forming a biomass which exceeds that of all plants and animals. Bacteria are vital in recycling nutrients, with many of the stages in nutrient cycles dependent on these organisms, such as the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere and putrefaction. In the biological communities surrounding hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds, such as hydrogen sulphide and methane, to energy. On 17 March 2013, researchers reported data that suggested bacterial life forms thrive in the Mariana Trench, which with a depth of up to 11 kilometres is the deepest part of the Earth's oceans.

"The domestication of poultry took place several thousand years ago. This may have originally been as a result of people hatching and rearing young birds from eggs collected from the wild, but later involved keeping the birds permanently in captivity. Domesticated chickens may have been used for cockfighting at first and quail kept for their songs, but soon it was realised how useful it was having a captive-bred source of food. Selective breeding for fast growth, egg-laying ability, conformation, plumage and docility took place over the centuries, and modern breeds often look very different from their wild ancestors. Although some birds are still kept in small flocks in extensive systems, most birds available in the market today are reared in intensive commercial enterprises. Poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat globally and, along with eggs, provides nutritionally beneficial food containing high-quality protein accompanied by a low proportion of fat. All poultry meat should be properly handled and sufficiently cooked in order to reduce the risk of food poisoning.",369,How long ago did domestication of poultry take place?,several thousand years ago,today,first,second,1,"እቲ domestication ካብ poultry ምውሳድ ቦታ ቡዙሓት ሽሕ ዓመታት .ቕድሚ እዚ ተዝኸዉን ኣለኒ originally ዝነበረ ከም ሓደ ውፅኢት ካብ ህዝቢ hatching እና rearing ንእሽተይ birds ካብ eggs collected ካብ እቲ ,ልቂ ግን ዳሕራይ ዝተኻተተ keeping እቲ birds permanently አብ ውሽጢ .captivity Domesticated chickens ተዝኸዉን ኣለኒ ዝነበረ ዘገልገለ ን cockfighting ኣብ መጀመርታ እና quail ዝተዓቀበ ን ናቶም ,songs ግን አብ ቀረባ እቲ ነገር ኔሩ realised ከመይ ጠቃሚ እቲ ነገር ኔሩ ምህላው ሓደ -captive-bred ፍልፍል ካብ .ምግቢ Selective breeding ን ቅልጡፍ ,ዕቤት -egg-laying ,ተኽእሎ ,conformation plumage እና docility ምውሳድ ቦታ ልዕሊ እቲ ,centuries እና ዘበናዊ breeds ኩል ግዘ ረአ ብጣዕሚ ፍሉይ ካብ ናቶም ልቂ .ዓሌት ዋላ እኳ ንእሽተይ birds እዮም እስካብ ሕዚ ዝተዓቀበ አብ ውሽጢ ንኡስ flocks አብ ውሽጢ extensive ,systems ብጥዕሚ birds ቅሩብ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ዕዳጋ ሎምዓንቲ እዮም reared አብ ውሽጢ intensive ንግዳዊ .enterprises Poultry እዩ እቲ ካልኣይ ብጥዕሚ widely eaten ዓይነት ካብ ስጋ globally ,እና ማዕረ ኣንፈት ምስ ,eggs provides nutritionally beneficial ምግቢ containing -high-quality protein accompanied ብ ሓደ ውሑድ proportion ካብ .ረጒድ ኩሎም poultry ስጋ ይሓይሽ ኩን ብግቡእ handled እና sufficiently cooked አብ ውሽጢ ስርዓት ናብ ቀንስ እቲ ሓደጋ ካብ ምግቢ .poisoning",ከመይ ነዊሕ ቕድሚ ግቡር domestication ካብ poultry ውሰድ ?ቦታ,ቡዙሓት ሽሕ ዓመታት ቕድሚ,ሎምዓንቲ,መጀመርታ,ካልኣይ

"Many early immigrant groups traveled to America to worship freely, particularly after the English Civil War and religious conflict in France and Germany. They included nonconformists like the Puritans, who were Protestant Christians fleeing religious persecution from the Anglican King of England. Despite a common background, the groups' views on religious toleration were mixed. While some such as Roger Williams of Rhode Island and William Penn of Pennsylvania ensured the protection of religious minorities within their colonies, others like the Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony had established churches. The Dutch colony of New Netherland established the Dutch Reformed Church and outlawed all other worship, though enforcement was sparse.

"According to Walter Gratzer, the study of nutrition probably began during the 6th century BC. In China, the concept of Qi developed, a spirit or ""wind"" similar to what Western Europeans later called pneuma. Food was classified into ""hot"" (for example, meats, blood, ginger, and hot spices) and ""cold"" (green vegetables) in China, India, Malaya, and Persia. Humours developed perhaps first in China alongside qi. Ho the Physician concluded that diseases are caused by deficiencies of elements (Wu Xing: fire, water, earth, wood, and metal), and he classified diseases as well as prescribed diets. About the same time in Italy, Alcmaeon of Croton (a Greek) wrote of the importance of equilibrium between what goes in and what goes out, and warned that imbalance would result disease marked by obesity or emaciation.",384,Who says that the study of nutrition probably began in the 6th century BC?,India,Walter Gratzer,Qi,BC,2,"ከም ናብ Walter ,Gratzer እቲ መፅናዕቲ ካብ ኣመጋግባ ናይ ምዃን ዕድል ጀሚሩ አብ እዋን እቲ 6th ዘመን .BC አብ ውሽጢ ,China እቲ ጭብጢ ካብ Qi ,ምዕቡል ሓደ መንፈስ ወይ """"ንፋስ ተመሳሳሊ ናብ እንታይ Western Europeans ዳሕራይ ዝተፀወዐ .pneuma ምግቢ ኔሩ classified ናብ ውሽጢ """"ምዉቅ (ን ,ኣብነት ,meats ,ደም ,ዝንጅብል እና ምዉቅ )spices እና """"ቁሪ (ቆፅለዋይ )ኣሕምልቲ አብ ውሽጢ ,China ,ህንዲ ,Malaya እና .Persia Humours ምዕቡል ምናልባት መጀመርታ አብ ውሽጢ China alongside .qi Ho እቲ Physician concluded እቲ ሕማማት እዮም caused ብ deficiencies ካብ elements (Wu :Xing ,ሓዊ ,ማይ ,መሬት ,ዕንጨይቲ እና ),ሓጺን እና ንሱ classified ሕማማት ከም ደሓን ከም prescribed .diets ብዝዕባ እቲ ማዕረ ግዜ አብ ውሽጢ ,Italy Alcmaeon ካብ Croton (ሓደ )Greek ጽሒፉ ካብ እቲ importance ካብ equilibrium አብ መንጎ እንታይ ይኸድ አብ ውሽጢ እና እንታይ ይኸድ ,ደገ እና warned እቲ imbalance ይኸውን ውፅኢት ሕማም marked ብ መጠኑ ዝሓለፈ ርጉዲ ወይ .emaciation",መን says እቲ እቲ መፅናዕቲ ካብ ኣመጋግባ ናይ ምዃን ዕድል ጀሚሩ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 6th ዘመን ?BC,ህንዲ,Walter Gratzer,Qi,BC
"Presbyterian history is part of the history of Christianity, but the beginning of Presbyterianism as a distinct movement occurred during the 16th-century Protestant Reformation. As the Catholic Church resisted the reformers, several different theological movements splintered from the Church and bore different denominations. Presbyterianism was especially influenced by the French theologian John Calvin, who is credited with the development of Reformed theology, and the work of John Knox, a Scotsman who studied with Calvin in Geneva, Switzerland and brought his teachings back to Scotland. The Presbyterian church traces its ancestry back primarily to England and Scotland. In August 1560 the Parliament of Scotland adopted the Scots Confession as the creed of the Scottish Kingdom. In December 1560, the First Book of Discipline was published, outlining important doctrinal issues but also establishing regulations for church government, including the creation of ten ecclesiastical districts with appointed superintendents which later became known as presbyteries.",385,Who is credited with the development of Reformed theology?,John Ca,the 16th-century,ten,the Scots Confession,1,"Presbyterian ታሪኽ እዩ ክፋል ካብ እቲ ታሪኽ ካብ ,Christianity ግን እቲ መጀመርታ ካብ Presbyterianism ከም ሓደ ዝጠፈአ ምንቅስቓስ ዝተፈጠረ አብ እዋን እቲ -16th-century Protestant .Reformation ከም እቲ Catholic ቤተ ክርስትያን resisted እቲ ,reformers ቡዙሓት ፍሉይ theological movements splintered ካብ እቲ ቤተ ክርስትያን እና ደባሪ ፍሉይ .denominations Presbyterianism ኔሩ ብፍላይ influenced ብ እቲ French theologian John ,Calvin መን እዩ credited ምስ እቲ ዕብየት ካብ Reformed ,theology እና እቲ ስራሕ ካብ John ,Knox ሓደ Scotsman መን studied ምስ Calvin አብ ውሽጢ ,Geneva Switzerland እና ምምፃእ ናቱ teachings ዝባን ናብ .Scotland እቲ Presbyterian ቤተ ክርስትያን traces ናቱ ancestry ዝባን primarily ናብ England እና .Scotland አብ ውሽጢ ነሓሰ 1560 እቲ Parliament ካብ Scotland adopted እቲ Scots Confession ከም እቲ creed ካብ እቲ Scottish .Kingdom አብ ውሽጢ ታሕሳስ ,1560 እቲ መጀመርታ መፅሓፍ ካብ ስርዓት ኔሩ ,published outlining ጠቃሚ doctrinal ፀገማት ግን እውን establishing regulations ን ቤተ ክርስትያን ,መንግስቲ ይሓውስ እቲ creation ካብ ዓሰርተ ecclesiastical districts ምስ appointed superintendents አየናይ ዳሕራይ ኮይኑ ፍሉጥ ከም .presbyteries",መን እዩ credited ምስ እቲ ዕብየት ካብ Reformed ?theology,John Ca,እቲ -16th-century,ዓሰርተ,እቲ Scots Confession

"In 2007, two FAA whistleblowers, inspectors Charalambe ""Bobby"" Boutris and Douglas E. Peters, alleged that Boutris said he attempted to ground Southwest after finding cracks in the fuselage, but was prevented by supervisors he said were friendly with the airline. This was validated by a report by the Department of Transportation which found FAA managers had allowed Southwest Airlines to fly 46 airplanes in 2006 and 2007 that were overdue for safety inspections, ignoring concerns raised by inspectors. Audits of other airlines resulted in two airlines grounding hundreds of planes, causing thousands of flight cancellations. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held hearings in April 2008. Jim Oberstar, former chairman of the committee said its investigation uncovered a pattern of regulatory abuse and widespread regulatory lapses, allowing 117 aircraft to be operated commercially although not in compliance with FAA safety rules. Oberstar said there was a ""culture of coziness"" between senior FAA officials and the airlines and ""a systematic breakdown"" in the FAA's culture that resulted in ""malfeasance, bordering on corruption."" In 2008 the FAA proposed to fine Southwest $10.2 million for failing to inspect older planes for cracks, and in 2009 Southwest and the FAA agreed that Southwest would pay a $7.5 million penalty and would adopt new safety procedures, with the fine doubling if Southwest failed to follow through.",387,What was the name of the whistleblower that accused Boutris of trying to ground Southwest?,Charalambe,FAA,April 2008,hundreds,1,"አብ ውሽጢ ,2007 ክልተ FAA ,whistleblowers inspectors Charalambe """"Bobby Boutris እና Douglas .E ,Peters alleged እቲ Boutris ኢሉ ንሱ attempted ናብ ምድሪ Southwest ድሕሪ finding cracks አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ,fuselage ግን ኔሩ prevented ብ supervisors ንሱ ኢሉ ኔሮም ምቕሉል ምስ እቲ .airline እዚ ኔሩ validated ብ ሓደ ኣፍልጥ ብ እቲ ክፍሊ ካብ መጓዓዝያ አየናይ ተረኺቡ FAA managers ዝነበረ ተፈቂዱሉ Southwest Airlines ናብ ንፈር 46 airplanes አብ ውሽጢ 2006 እና 2007 እቲ ኔሮም overdue ን ድሕንነት ,inspections ignoring concerns ተሰአ ብ .inspectors Audits ካብ ካልእ airlines resulted አብ ውሽጢ ክልተ airlines grounding hundreds ካብ ,planes causing thousands ካብ በረራ .cancellations እቲ ገዛ መጓዓዝያ እና Infrastructure Committee ተገይሩ hearings አብ ውሽጢ ጉንበት .2008 Jim ,Oberstar ናይ ቀደም chairman ካብ እቲ committee ኢሉ ናቱ investigation uncovered ሓደ ንድፊ ካብ regulatory ፀረፈ እና widespread regulatory ,lapses allowing 117 aircraft ናብ ኩን operated commercially ዋላ እኳ ዘይኮነ አብ ውሽጢ ምእዙዝነት ምስ FAA ድሕንነት .ስርዓታት Oberstar ኢሉ ኣብቲ ኔሩ ሓደ ""ባህሊ ካብ ""coziness አብ መንጎ ላዕለዋይ FAA officials እና እቲ airlines እና ""ሓደ systematic ""breakdown አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 'FAA's ባህሊ እቲ resulted አብ ውሽጢ "",malfeasance bordering አብ ልዕሊ .""corruption አብ ውሽጢ 2008 እቲ FAA proposed ናብ ደሓን Southwest $.10.2 ሚልዮን ን failing ናብ inspect older planes ን ,cracks እና አብ ውሽጢ 2009 Southwest እና እቲ FAA agreed እቲ Southwest ይኸውን ክፈል ሓደ $.7.5 ሚልዮን penalty እና ይኸውን ተቐባልነት ሓድሽ ድሕንነት ,procedures ምስ እቲ ደሓን doubling እንተ Southwest ወዲቑ ናብ ተኸተል .ብውሽጢ",እንታይ ኔሩ እቲ ሽም ካብ እቲ whistleblower እቲ ተኸሰሰ Boutris ካብ trying ናብ ምድሪ ?Southwest,Charalambe,FAA,ጉንበት 2008,hundreds
"Depleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter).",388,What metal is used in containers to store and transport radioactive materials?,—,—,depleted uranium,—,3,"Depleted uranium እዩ እውን ዘገልገለ ከም ሓደ shielding ናውቲ አብ ውሽጢ ንእሽተይ containers ዘገልገለ ናብ መኽዝን እና መጓዓዝያ radioactive .materials እስካብ እቲ ሓጺን itself እዩ ,radioactive ናቱ ላዕሊ ፃዕቒ makes እቲ ነገር ቡዙሕ ውፅኢታዊ ካብ ምራሕ አብ ውሽጢ halting radiation ካብ ጠንካራ sources ከምዚ ከም .radium ካልእ uses ካብ depleted uranium ይሓውስ counterweights ን aircraft ምቁጽጻር ,surfaces ከም ballast ን missile -re-entry vehicles እና ከም ሓደ shielding .ናውቲ መወዳእታ ናብ ናቱ ላዕሊ ,ፃዕቒ እዚ ናውቲ እዩ ተረኺቡ አብ ውሽጢ inertial ሓጋዚ systems እና አብ ውሽጢ gyroscopic .compasses Depleted uranium እዩ preferred ልዕሊ similarly dense metals መወዳእታ ናብ ናቱ ተኽእሎ ናብ ኩን ብቐሊሉ machined እና ምስሊ ከም ደሓን ከም ናቱ relatively ውሑድ .ዋጋ እቲ ዋና ሓደጋ ካብ ተቃላዕነት ናብ depleted uranium እዩ chemical poisoning ብ uranium oxide ይመርፅ ካብ radioactivity (uranium ፍጥረት ጥራሕ ሓደ ድኹም alpha ).emitter",እንታይ ሓጺን እዩ ዘገልገለ አብ ውሽጢ containers ናብ መኽዝን እና መጓዓዝያ radioactive ?materials,—,—,depleted uranium,—

"Cubism began between 1907 and 1911. Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon has often been considered a proto-Cubist work. Georges Braque's 1908 Houses at L’Estaque (and related works) prompted the critic Louis Vauxcelles to refer to bizarreries cubiques (cubic oddities). Gertrude Stein referred to landscapes made by Picasso in 1909, such as Reservoir at Horta de Ebro, as the first Cubist paintings. The first organized group exhibition by Cubists took place at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris during the spring of 1911 in a room called 'Salle 41'; it included works by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and Henri Le Fauconnier, yet no works by Picasso or Braque were exhibited.",395,What was the first time that Cubism started?,Reservoir,Horta de Ebro,Braque,between 1907 and 1911,4,"Cubism ጀሚሩ አብ መንጎ 1907 እና .1911 Pablo 'Picasso's 1907 ስእሊ Les Demoiselles 'd'Avignon ኣለዎ ኩል ግዘ ዝነበረ ገምገመ ሓደ -proto-Cubist .ስራሕ Georges 'Braque's 1908 Houses ኣብ L’Estaque (እና ዝተኣሳሰረ )works prompted እቲ critic Louis Vauxcelles ናብ ምራሕ ናብ bizarreries cubiques (cubic ).oddities Gertrude Stein referred ናብ landscapes ዝተሰርሐ ብ Picasso አብ ውሽጢ ,1909 ከምዚ ከም Reservoir ኣብ Horta de ,Ebro ከም እቲ መጀመርታ Cubist .paintings እቲ መጀመርታ organized ጉጅለ ምርኢት ብ Cubists ምውሳድ ቦታ ኣብ እቲ Salon des Indépendants አብ ውሽጢ Paris አብ እዋን እቲ ፅድያ ካብ 1911 አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ክፍሊ ዝተፀወዐ 'Salle ';41 እቲ ነገር included works ብ Jean ,Metzinger Albert ,Gleizes Fernand ,Léger Robert Delaunay እና Henri Le ,Fauconnier እስካብ ዛሕዚ አይኮንን works ብ Picasso ወይ Braque ኔሮም .exhibited",እንታይ ኔሩ እቲ መጀመርታ ግዜ እቲ Cubism ?ተጀሚሩ,Reservoir,Horta de Ebro,Braque,አብ መንጎ 1907 እና 1911
"According to the canonical gospels, Jesus, whom Christians believe to be the Son of God as well as the Messiah (Christ), was arrested, tried, and sentenced by Pontius Pilate to be scourged, and finally crucified by the Romans. Jesus was stripped of his clothing and offered wine mixed with gall to drink, before being crucified. He was then hung for six hours (according to Mark's Gospel) between two convicted thieves. During this time, the soldiers affixed a sign to the top of the cross stating ""Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews"" in three languages. They then divided his garments among them, but cast lots for his seamless robe. After Jesus' death they pierced his side with a spear to be certain that he had died.

"A capacitor (originally known as a condenser) is a passive two-terminal electrical component used to store electrical energy temporarily in an electric field. The forms of practical capacitors vary widely, but all contain at least two electrical conductors (plates) separated by a dielectric (i.e. an insulator that can store energy by becoming polarized). The conductors can be thin films, foils or sintered beads of metal or conductive electrolyte, etc. The nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity. Materials commonly used as dielectrics include glass, ceramic, plastic film, air, vacuum, paper, mica, and oxide layers. Capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices. Unlike a resistor, an ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy.

"Chinese political philosophy dates back to the Spring and Autumn Period, specifically with Confucius in the 6th century BC. Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States period. The major philosophies during the period, Confucianism, Legalism, Mohism, Agrarianism and Taoism, each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as Confucius, Mencius, and Mozi, focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, meritocratic government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and laws. Mohism advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on frugality and ascetism. The Agrarians advocated a peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism. Taoism advocated a proto-anarchism. Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the Qin Dynasty, but was replaced by State Confucianism in the Han Dynasty. Prior to China's adoption of communism, State Confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of China up to the 20th century.",398,Which political philosophy dates back to the Spring and Autumn Period?,the Spring and Autumn Period,Agrarianism,Agrarians,Chinese,4,"Chinese political ፍልስፍና dates ዝባን ናብ እቲ ፅድያ እና ፅድያ ,ግዘ specifically ምስ Confucius አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 6th ዘመን .BC Chinese political ፍልስፍና ኔሩ ምዕቡል ከም ሓደ ምላሽ ናብ እቲ ማሕበራዊ እና political breakdown ካብ እቲ ሃገር characteristic ካብ እቲ ፅድያ እና ፅድያ ግዘ እና እቲ Warring States .ግዘ እቲ ዋና philosophies አብ እዋን እቲ ,ግዘ ,Confucianism ,Legalism ,Mohism Agrarianism እና ,Taoism ሕድሕድ ዝነበረ ሓደ political ገጽታ ናብ ናቶም philosophical .schools Philosophers ከምዚ ከም ,Confucius ,Mencius እና ,Mozi focused አብ ልዕሊ political unity እና political stability ከም እቲ basis ካብ ናቶም political .philosophies Confucianism advocated ሓደ ,hierarchical meritocratic መንግስቲ መሰረት ዝገበረ አብ ልዕሊ ,ድንጋጸ ,ተኣማንነት እና interpersonal .relationships Legalism advocated ሓደ highly authoritarian መንግስቲ መሰረት ዝገበረ አብ ልዕሊ draconian punishments እና .laws Mohism advocated ሓደ ,communal decentralized መንግስቲ centered አብ ልዕሊ frugality እና .ascetism እቲ Agrarians advocated ሓደ peasant utopian communalism እና .egalitarianism Taoism advocated ሓደ -.proto-anarchism Legalism ኔሩ እቲ ዓብላሊ political ፍልስፍና ካብ እቲ Qin ,Dynasty ግን ኔሩ replaced ብ ግዝኣት Confucianism አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Han .Dynasty ቅድሚያ ናብ 'China's adoption ካብ ,communism ግዝኣት Confucianism remained እቲ ዓብላሊ political ፍልስፍና ካብ China ሓፍ ናብ እቲ 20th .ዘመን",አየናይ political ፍልስፍና dates ዝባን ናብ እቲ ፅድያ እና ፅድያ ?ግዘ,እቲ ፅድያ እና ፅድያ ግዘ,Agrarianism,Agrarians,Chinese

"The first use of asphalt/bitumen in the New World was by indigenous peoples. On the west coast, as early as the 13th century, the Tongva, Luiseño and Chumash peoples collected the naturally occurring asphalt/bitumen that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits. All three used the substance as an adhesive. It is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items. For example, it was used on rattles to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles. It was also used in decorations. Small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations. It was used as a sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying water. Asphaltum was used also to seal the planks on ocean-going canoes.",403,When was the first use of asphalt in the New World?,three,Tongva,the 13th century,Luiseño,3,"እቲ መጀመርታ ጥቅሚ ካብ /asphalt/bitumen አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ሓድሽ ዓለም ኔሩ ብ ዘይእሩም .peoples አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ምዕራብ ,ገማግም ከም ብግዘ ከም እቲ 13th ,ዘመን እቲ ,Tongva Luiseño እና Chumash peoples collected እቲ naturally occurring /asphalt/bitumen እቲ seeped ናብ እቲ ገፅ ኣብ ልዕሊ underlying petroleum .deposits ኩሎም ሰለስተ ዘገልገለ እቲ ዓውደ ኣካል ከም ሓደ .adhesive እቲ ነገር እዩ ተረኺቡ አብ ልዕሊ ቡዙሕ ፍሉይ artifacts ካብ መሳረሕታት እና ceremonial .ኣቕሑ ን ,ኣብነት እቲ ነገር ኔሩ ዘገልገለ አብ ልዕሊ rattles ናብ adhere gourds ወይ ኣባጎብየ shells ናብ rattle .handles እቲ ነገር ኔሩ እውን ዘገልገለ አብ ውሽጢ .decorations ንኡስ ዓንኬል ዛዕጎል beads ኔሮም ኩል ግዘ ፅምዲ አብ ውሽጢ asphaltum ናብ ምቅራብ .decorations እቲ ነገር ኔሩ ዘገልገለ ከም ሓደ sealant አብ ልዕሊ baskets ናብ ስራሕ ንሶም watertight ን carrying .ማይ Asphaltum ኔሩ ዘገልገለ እውን ናብ ሽፋን እቲ planks አብ ልዕሊ -ocean-going .canoes",መዓዝ ኔሩ እቲ መጀመርታ ጥቅሚ ካብ asphalt አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ሓድሽ ?ዓለም,ሰለስተ,Tongva,እቲ 13th ዘመን,Luiseño

"The Scottish traveler James Bruce reported in 1770 that Medri Bahri was a distinct political entity from Abyssinia, noting that the two territories were frequently in conflict. The Bahre-Nagassi (""Kings of the Sea"") alternately fought with or against the Abyssinians and the neighbouring Muslim Adal Sultanate depending on the geopolitical circumstances. Medri Bahri was thus part of the Christian resistance against Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi of Adal's forces, but later joined the Adalite states and the Ottoman Empire front against Abyssinia in 1572.

"While attending Ealing Art College, Tim Staffell became friends with Farrokh Bulsara, a fellow student who had assumed the English name of Freddie. Bulsara felt that he and the band had the same tastes and soon became a keen fan of Smile. In late 1970, after Staffell left to join the band Humpy Bong, the remaining Smile members, encouraged by Bulsara, changed their name to ""Queen"" and continued working together. When asked about the name, Bulsara explained, ""I thought up the name Queen. It's just a name, but it's very regal obviously, and it sounds splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. It had a lot of visual potential and was open to all sorts of interpretations.

"In physics, energy is a property of objects which can be transferred to other objects or converted into different forms. The ""ability of a system to perform work"" is a common description, but it is difficult to give one single comprehensive definition of energy because of its many forms.

A regular curriculum includes courses in Arabic, tafsir (Qur'anic interpretation), sharīʻah (Islamic law), hadiths (recorded sayings and deeds of Muhammad), mantiq (logic), and Muslim history.

"The Ming initiated sporadic armed intervention in Tibet during the 14th century, but did not garrison permanent troops there. At times the Tibetans also used armed resistance against Ming forays. The Wanli Emperor (r. 1572–1620) made attempts to reestablish Sino-Tibetan relations after the Mongol-Tibetan alliance initiated in 1578, which affected the foreign policy of the subsequent Qing dynasty (1644–1912) of China in their support for the Dalai Lama of the Gelug school. By the late 16th century, the Mongols were successful armed protectors of the Gelug Dalai Lama, after increasing their presence in the Amdo region.

Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorised according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).",422,What is a term for literature as it's composed of written productions?,—,—,Latin,li,4,"ስነ ጽሑፍ consists ካብ ዝተፀሓፈ ,productions ኩል ግዘ restricted ናብ እቲኦም deemed ናብ ኣለኒ artistic ወይ ምሁራዊ .ዋጋ ናቱ Latin ሱር /literatura/litteratura (derived itself ካብ ,littera ደብዳበ ወይ )handwriting ኔሩ ዘገልገለ ናብ ምራሕ ናብ ኩሎም ዝተፀሓፈ ,accounts ግን intertwined ምስ እቲ roman ጭብጢ ካብ :cultura ምምሃር ወይ .cultivation ስነ ጽሑፍ ኩል ግዘ uses ቋንቋ differently ካብ ተራ ቋንቋ (ረአ ).literariness ስነ ጽሑፍ ይኽእል ኩን classified ከም ናብ ዶ እቲ ነገር እዩ ልበ ወለድ ወይ -non-fiction እና ዶ እቲ ነገር እዩ ግጥሚ ወይ ;prose እቲ ነገር ይኽእል ኩን ርሑቅ distinguished ከም ናብ ዋና forms ከምዚ ከም እቲ ,ልበ ወለድ ሓፂር ዛንታ ወይ ;ድራማ እና works እዮም ኩል ግዘ categorised ከም ናብ historical periods ወይ ናቶም adherence ናብ ውሱን ሥነ-ጽባቐ መለለይታት ወይ expectations ().ወግዒ",እንታይ እዩ ሓደ ቃል ን ስነ ጽሑፍ ከም 'እዩ composed ካብ ዝተፀሓፈ ?productions,—,—,Latin,li

Micro connectors were designed with frequent charging of portable devices in mind; not only is design lifetime of the connector improved to 10,000 cycles, but it was also redesigned to place the flexible contacts, which wear out sooner, on the easily replaced cable, while the more durable rigid contacts are located in the micro-USB receptacles.

"As a defining aspect of what it means to be human, culture is a central concept in anthropology, encompassing the range of phenomena that are transmitted through social learning in human societies. The word is used in a general sense as the evolved ability to categorize and represent experiences with symbols and to act imaginatively and creatively. This ability arose with the evolution of behavioral modernity in humans around 50,000 years ago.[citation needed] This capacity is often thought to be unique to humans, although some other species have demonstrated similar, though much less complex abilities for social learning. It is also used to denote the complex networks of practices and accumulated knowledge and ideas that is transmitted through social interaction and exist in specific human groups, or cultures, using the plural form. Some aspects of human behavior, such as language, social practices such as kinship, gender and marriage, expressive forms such as art, music, dance, ritual, religion, and technologies such as cooking, shelter, clothing are said to be cultural universals, found in all human societies. The concept material culture covers the physical expressions of culture, such as technology, architecture and art, whereas the immaterial aspects of culture such as principles of social organization (including, practices of political organization and social institutions), mythology, philosophy, literature (both written and oral), and science make up the intangible cultural heritage of a society.",428,What is a defining aspect of human meaning?,letters.n.01,culture,"around 50,000 years",cranberry culture.n.01,2,"ከም ሓደ defining ገጽታ ካብ እንታይ እቲ ነገር ማለት ናብ ኩን ,ሰብ ባህሊ እዩ ሓደ central ጭብጢ አብ ውሽጢ ,anthropology encompassing እቲ ግዝፈት ካብ phenomena እቲ እዮም transmitted ብውሽጢ ማሕበራዊ ምምሃር አብ ውሽጢ ሰብ .societies እቲ ቃል እዩ ዘገልገለ አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ሓፈሻዊ ትርጉም ከም እቲ evolved ተኽእሎ ናብ categorize እና ውክልና experiences ምስ symbols እና ናብ ፍፃመ imaginatively እና .creatively እዚ ተኽእሎ arose ምስ እቲ ደፋእታዊ ለውጢ ካብ behavioral modernity አብ ውሽጢ humans አብ ከባቢ ,50,000 ዓመታት .[ago.[citation ]needed እዚ ትኽእሎ እዩ ኩል ግዘ ሓሳብ ናብ ኩን ዝተፈለየ ናብ ,humans ዋላ እኳ ንእሽተይ ካልእ ዓሌታት ኣለኒ demonstrated ,ተመሳሳሊ እኳ ብዙሕ ዝወሓደ ሕውስዋስ abilities ን ማሕበራዊ .ምምሃር እቲ ነገር እዩ እውን ዘገልገለ ናብ denote እቲ ሕውስዋስ networks ካብ practices እና accumulated ፍልጠት እና ideas እቲ እዩ transmitted ብውሽጢ ማሕበራዊ ምትሕብባር እና ምህላው አብ ውሽጢ ዝተወሰነ ሰብ ,groups ወይ ,cultures using እቲ ብዙሕ .ፎርም ንእሽተይ aspects ካብ ሰብ ,ፀባይ ከምዚ ከም ,ቋንቋ ማሕበራዊ practices ከምዚ ከም ,kinship ፆታ እና ,መርዓ expressive forms ከምዚ ከም ,ጥበብ ,ሙዚቃ ,ሳዕስዒት ,ritual ,ሃይማኖት እና technologies ከምዚ ከም ,ምግቢ ምኽሻን ,መፅለሊ clothing እዮም ኢሉ ናብ ኩን cultural ,universals ተረኺቡ አብ ውሽጢ ኩሎም ሰብ .societies እቲ ጭብጢ ናውቲ ባህሊ covers እቲ ኣካላዊ expressions ካብ ,ባህሊ ከምዚ ከም ,ቴክኖሎጂ ኣርክቴክቸር እና ,ጥበብ ክኸውን ከሎ እቲ immaterial aspects ካብ ባህሊ ከምዚ ከም principles ካብ ማሕበራዊ ውድብ (,ይሓውስ practices ካብ political ውድብ እና ማሕበራዊ ),institutions ,mythology ,ፍልስፍና ስነ ጽሑፍ (ክልቲኡ ዝተፀሓፈ እና ),oral እና ሳይንስ ስራሕ ሓፍ እቲ intangible cultural ቅርሲ ካብ ሓደ .ሕብረተሰብ",እንታይ እዩ ሓደ defining ገጽታ ካብ ሰብ ?ትርጉም,..letters.n.01,ባህሊ,"አብ ከባቢ ,50,000 ዓመታት",cranberry ..culture.n.01
"The English term comics is used as a singular noun when it refers to the medium and a plural when referring to particular instances, such as individual strips or comic books. Though the term derives from the humorous (or comic) work that predominated in early American newspaper comic strips, it has become standard also for non-humorous works. It is common in English to refer to the comics of different cultures by the terms used in their original languages, such as manga for Japanese comics, or bandes dessinées for French-language comics. There is no consensus amongst theorists and historians on a definition of comics; some emphasize the combination of images and text, some sequentiality or other image relations, and others historical aspects such as mass reproduction or the use of recurring characters. The increasing cross-pollination of concepts from different comics cultures and eras has further made definition difficult.",429,Which language is the term comics used in?,American,English,king's english.n.01,old english.n.01,2,"እቲ ኢንግሊሽ ቃል comics እዩ ዘገልገለ ከም ሓደ singular ስም መዓዝ እቲ ነገር refers ናብ እቲ ማእኸላይ እና ሓደ ብዙሕ መዓዝ referring ናብ ብፍሉይ ,instances ከምዚ ከም ውልቀ ሰብ strips ወይ comic .books እኳ እቲ ቃል derives ካብ እቲ humorous (ወይ )comic ስራሕ እቲ predominated አብ ውሽጢ ብግዘ American newspaper comic ,strips እቲ ነገር ኣለዎ ምዃን መለክዒ እውን ን -non-humorous .works እቲ ነገር እዩ ልሙድ አብ ውሽጢ ኢንግሊሽ ናብ ምራሕ ናብ እቲ comics ካብ ፍሉይ cultures ብ እቲ ስያመታት ዘገልገለ አብ ውሽጢ ናቶም ኦርጂናል ,languages ከምዚ ከም manga ን Japanese ,comics ወይ bandes dessinées ን -French-language .comics ኣብቲ እዩ አይኮንን consensus amongst theorists እና historians አብ ልዕሊ ሓደ ኣገላልፃ ካብ ;comics ንእሽተይ ኣድህቦ ምሃብ እቲ ጥምረት ካብ images እና ,ጽሑፍ ንእሽተይ sequentiality ወይ ካልእ ስእሊ ,relations እና others historical aspects ከምዚ ከም መጠን ኣካል reproduction ወይ እቲ ጥቅሚ ካብ recurring .characters እቲ increasing -cross-pollination ካብ concepts ካብ ፍሉይ comics cultures እና eras ኣለዎ ርሑቅ ዝተሰርሐ ኣገላልፃ .ከቢድ",አየናይ ቋንቋ እዩ እቲ ቃል comics ዘገልገለ ?አብ ውሽጢ,American,ኢንግሊሽ,'king's ..english.n.01,ዓብይ ..english.n.01
"Muslims believe the Quran was verbally revealed by God to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel (Jibril), gradually over a period of approximately 23 years, beginning on 22 December 609 CE, when Muhammad was 40, and concluding in 632, the year of his death. Muslims regard the Quran as the most important miracle of Muhammad, a proof of his prophethood, and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam and ended with Muhammad.

"Gymnasts sprint down a runway, which is a maximum of 25 meters in length, before hurdling onto a spring board. The gymnast is allowed to choose where they start on the runway. The body position is maintained while ""punching"" (blocking using only a shoulder movement) the vaulting platform. The gymnast then rotates to a standing position. In advanced gymnastics, multiple twists and somersaults may be added before landing. Successful vaults depend on the speed of the run, the length of the hurdle, the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle, the kinesthetic awareness in the air, and the speed of rotation in the case of more difficult and complex vaults.",431,What do gymnasts sprint down a runway on?,—,25 meters,a spring board,—,3,"Gymnasts sprint ታሕቲ ሓደ ,runway አየናይ እዩ ሓደ maximum ካብ 25 meters አብ ውሽጢ ,ንውሓት ቅድሚ hurdling onto ሓደ ፅድያ .ፀፊሕ ጣውላ እቲ gymnast እዩ ተፈቂዱሉ ናብ ምረፅ አበይ ንሶም ጀምር አብ ልዕሊ እቲ .runway እቲ ሰውነት ቦታ እዩ maintained እስካብ """"punching (blocking using ጥራሕ ሓደ መንኰብ )ምንቅስቓስ እቲ vaulting .ንድፊ እቲ gymnast ሽዑ rotates ናብ ሓደ standing .ቦታ አብ ውሽጢ ዝተመሓየሸ ,gymnastics multiple twists እና somersaults ተዝኸዉን ኩን added ቅድሚ .landing ዕውት vaults ይጽጋዕ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ፍጥነት ካብ እቲ ,ጉየ እቲ ንውሓት ካብ እቲ ,hurdle እቲ ሓይሊ እቲ gymnast generates ካብ እቲ legs እና መንኰብ ,girdle እቲ kinesthetic ኣፍልጦ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ,ኣየር እና እቲ ፍጥነት ካብ rotation አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ጉዳይ ካብ ቡዙሕ ከቢድ እና ሕውስዋስ .vaults",እንታይ ግበር gymnasts sprint ታሕቲ ሓደ runway ?አብ ልዕሊ,—,25 meters,ሓደ ፅድያ ፀፊሕ ጣውላ,—

There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public, but during the first half of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the Church of England, while science was part of natural theology. Ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique, unrelated to other animals.

"Jews originated as a national and religious group in the Middle East during the second millennium BCE, in the part of the Levant known as the Land of Israel. The Merneptah Stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel, associated with the god El, somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE. The Israelites, as an outgrowth of the Canaanite population, consolidated their hold with the emergence of the Kingdom of Israel, and the Kingdom of Judah. Some consider that these Canaanite sedentary Israelites melded with incoming nomadic groups known as 'Hebrews'. Though few sources in the Bible mention the exilic periods in detail, the experience of diaspora life, from the Ancient Egyptian rule over the Levant, to Assyrian Captivity and Exile, to Babylonian Captivity and Exile, to Seleucid Imperial rule, to the Roman occupation, and the historical relations between Israelites and the homeland, became a major feature of Jewish history, identity and memory.",435,When did Jews start as a national and religious group in the Middle East?,Bible,BCE,Hebrews,the Kingdom of Israel,2,"Jews originated ከም ሓደ ሃገራዊ እና ሃይማኖታዊ ጉጅለ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ማእኸል ምብራቅ አብ እዋን እቲ ካልኣይ millennium ,BCE አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ክፋል ካብ እቲ Levant ፍሉጥ ከም እቲ መሬት ካብ .Israel እቲ Merneptah Stele appears ናብ ኣረጋግፅ እቲ ህላወ ካብ ሓደ ህዝቢ ካብ ,Israel ተሓባበረ ምስ እቲ ፈጣሪ ,El somewhere አብ ውሽጢ Canaan ከም ርሑቅ ዝባን ከም እቲ 13th ዘመን .BCE እቲ ,Israelites ከም ሓደ outgrowth ካብ እቲ Canaanite ,በዝሒ ህዝቢ consolidated ናቶም ሓዝ ምስ እቲ emergence ካብ እቲ Kingdom ካብ ,Israel እና እቲ Kingdom ካብ .Judah ንእሽተይ ሕሰበሉ እቲ እዚ Canaanite sedentary Israelites melded ምስ incoming nomadic groups ፍሉጥ ከም ''.Hebrews እኳ ቁሩብ sources አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Bible ጥቀስ እቲ exilic periods አብ ውሽጢ ,ዝርዝር እቲ ተሞክሮ ካብ diaspora ,ህይወት ካብ እቲ ጥንታዊ Egyptian ስርዓት ልዕሊ እቲ ,Levant ናብ Assyrian Captivity እና ,Exile ናብ Babylonian Captivity እና ,Exile ናብ Seleucid Imperial ,ስርዓት ናብ እቲ Roman ,ሞያ እና እቲ historical relations አብ መንጎ Israelites እና እቲ ,homeland ኮይኑ ሓደ ዋና መለለዩ ካብ Jewish ,ታሪኽ መንነት እና .ተዘክሮ",መዓዝ ግቡር Jews ጀምር ከም ሓደ ሃገራዊ እና ሃይማኖታዊ ጉጅለ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ማእኸል ?ምብራቅ,Bible,BCE,Hebrews,እቲ Kingdom ካብ Israel
"Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a similar term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common practice period. The major time divisions of classical music are as follows: the early music period, which includes the Medieval (500–1400) and the Renaissance (1400–1600) eras; the Common practice period, which includes the Baroque (1600–1750), Classical (1750–1820), and Romantic eras (1804–1910); and the 20th century (1901–2000) which includes the modern (1890–1930) that overlaps from the late 19th-century, the high modern (mid 20th-century), and contemporary or postmodern (1975–2015) eras.[citation needed]",436,In what century was classical music first produced?,Classical,roughly the 11th century,Renaissance,Common,2,"Classical ሙዚቃ እዩ ጥበብ ሙዚቃ produced ወይ rooted አብ ውሽጢ እቲ traditions ካብ Western ,ሙዚቃ ይሓውስ ክልቲኡ liturgical ()ሃይማኖታዊ እና secular .ሙዚቃ እስካብ ሓደ ተመሳሳሊ ቃል እዩ እውን ዘገልገለ ናብ ምራሕ ናብ እቲ ግዘ ካብ 1750 ናብ 1820 (እቲ Classical ),ግዘ እዚ ዓንቀጽ እዩ ብዝዕባ እቲ ሰፊሕ ንውሓቱ ካብ ግዜ ካብ ዳርጋ እቲ 11th ዘመን ናብ እቲ እዋናዊ ,መዓልቲ አየናይ includes እቲ Classical ግዘ እና ዝተፈላለዩ ካልእ .periods እቲ central norms ካብ እዚ ልምዲ ኮይኑ codified አብ መንጎ 1550 እና ,1900 አየናይ እዩ ፍሉጥ ከም እቲ ልሙድ ትግበራ .ግዘ እቲ ዋና ግዜ divisions ካብ classical ሙዚቃ እዮም ከም :follows እቲ ብግዘ ሙዚቃ ,ግዘ አየናይ includes እቲ Medieval ()500–1400 እና እቲ Renaissance ()1400–1600 ;eras እቲ ልሙድ ትግበራ ,ግዘ አየናይ includes እቲ Baroque (),1600–1750 Classical (),1750–1820 እና Romantic eras ();1804–1910 እና እቲ 20th ዘመን ()1901–2000 አየናይ includes እቲ ዘበናዊ ()1890–1930 እቲ overlaps ካብ እቲ ረፋድ -,19th-century እቲ ላዕሊ ዘበናዊ (mid -),20th-century እና ወቕታዊ ወይ postmodern ()1975–2015 .[eras.[citation ]needed",አብ ውሽጢ እንታይ ዘመን ኔሩ classical ሙዚቃ መጀመርታ ?produced,Classical,ዳርጋ እቲ 11th ዘመን,Renaissance,ልሙድ

"Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989. The advent of Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.",442,When was Neptune discovered?,Solar System,Earth,23 September 1846,Triton,3,"Neptune እዩ ዘይኮነ visible ናብ እቲ unaided ዓይኒ እና እዩ እቲ ጥራሕ planet አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Solar ስርዓት ተረኺቡ ብ mathematical prediction ይመርፅ ካብ ብ empirical .ትዕዝብቲ Unexpected changes አብ ውሽጢ እቲ orbit ካብ Uranus መረሐ Alexis Bouvard ናብ deduce እቲ ናቱ orbit ኔሩ ዋና ናብ gravitational perturbation ብ ሓደ ዘይፍለጥ .planet Neptune ኔሩ subsequently observed ምስ ሓደ telescope አብ ልዕሊ 23 መስከረም 1846 ብ Johann Galle አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ መዐቀኒ ካብ እቲ ቦታ predicted ብ Urbain Le .Verrier ናቱ largest ,ወርሒ ,Triton ኔሩ discovered shortly ,thereafter እኳ ዋላ ሓደ ካብ እቲ 'planet's ዝተረፈ ፍሉጥ 14 moons ኔሮም located telescopically ክሳብ እቲ 20th .ዘመን እቲ 'planet's ርሕቐት ካብ መሬት gives እቲ ነገር ሓደ ብጣዕሚ ንኡስ ግልፂ ,ግዝፊ making እቲ ነገር challenging ናብ መፅናዕቲ ምስ -Earth-based .telescopes Neptune ኔሩ visited ብ Voyager ,2 መዓዝ እቲ ነገር ነፋሪት ብ እቲ planet አብ ልዕሊ 25 ነሓሰ .1989 እቲ advent ካብ Hubble ቦታ Telescope እና ገዚፍ -ground-based telescopes ምስ adaptive optics ኣለዎ ኣብ ቀረባ ተፈቂዱሉ ን ተወሳኺ detailed observations ካብ .afar",መዓዝ ኔሩ Neptune ?discovered,Solar ስርዓት,መሬት,23 መስከረም 1846,Triton
"From 7 September 1940, one year into the war, London was bombed by the Luftwaffe for 57 consecutive nights. More than one million London houses were destroyed or damaged and more than 40,000 civilians were killed, almost half of them in London. Ports and industrial centres outside London were also attacked. The main Atlantic sea port of Liverpool was bombed, causing nearly 4,000 deaths within the Merseyside area during the war. The North Sea port of Hull, a convenient and easily found target or secondary target for bombers unable to locate their primary targets, was subjected to 86 raids in the Hull Blitz during the war, with a conservative estimate of 1,200 civilians killed and 95 percent of its housing stock destroyed or damaged.

"First recognized in 1900 by Max Planck, it was originally the proportionality constant between the minimal increment of energy, E, of a hypothetical electrically charged oscillator in a cavity that contained black body radiation, and the frequency, f, of its associated electromagnetic wave. In 1905 the value E, the minimal energy increment of a hypothetical oscillator, was theoretically associated by Einstein with a ""quantum"" or minimal element of the energy of the electromagnetic wave itself. The light quantum behaved in some respects as an electrically neutral particle, as opposed to an electromagnetic wave.

"At the time, the Umayyad taxation and administrative practice were perceived as unjust by some Muslims. The Christian and Jewish population had still autonomy; their judicial matters were dealt with in accordance with their own laws and by their own religious heads or their appointees, although they did pay a poll tax for policing to the central state. Muhammad had stated explicitly during his lifetime that abrahamic religious groups (still a majority in times of the Umayyad Caliphate), should be allowed to practice their own religion, provided that they paid the jizya taxation. The welfare state of both the Muslim and the non-Muslim poor started by Umar ibn al Khattab had also continued. Muawiya's wife Maysum (Yazid's mother) was also a Christian. The relations between the Muslims and the Christians in the state were stable in this time. The Umayyads were involved in frequent battles with the Christian Byzantines without being concerned with protecting themselves in Syria, which had remained largely Christian like many other parts of the empire. Prominent positions were held by Christians, some of whom belonged to families that had served in Byzantine governments. The employment of Christians was part of a broader policy of religious assimilation that was necessitated by the presence of large Christian populations in the conquered provinces, as in Syria. This policy also boosted Muawiya's popularity and solidified Syria as his power base.",454,Who stated that abrahamic religious groups should be allowed to practice their own religion?,Muhammad,Yazid,Syria,Christian,1,"ኣብ እቲ ,ግዜ እቲ Umayyad taxation እና administrative ትግበራ ኔሮም perceived ከም unjust ብ ንእሽተይ .Muslims እቲ Christian እና Jewish በዝሒ ህዝቢ ዝነበረ እስካብ ሕዚ ;autonomy ናቶም judicial matters ኔሮም dealt ምስ አብ ውሽጢ accordance ምስ ናቶም ወንን laws እና ብ ናቶም ወንን ሃይማኖታዊ heads ወይ ናቶም ,appointees ዋላ እኳ ንሶም ግቡር ክፈል ሓደ poll tax ን policing ናብ እቲ central .ግዝኣት Muhammad ዝነበረ stated explicitly አብ እዋን ናቱ lifetime እቲ abrahamic ሃይማኖታዊ groups (እስካብ ሕዚ ሓደ መብዛሕትኡ አብ ውሽጢ times ካብ እቲ Umayyad ),Caliphate ይሓይሽ ኩን ተፈቂዱሉ ናብ ትግበራ ናቶም ወንን ,ሃይማኖት ተዳልዩ እቲ ንሶም ተኸፊሉ እቲ jizya .taxation እቲ ድሕንነት ግዝኣት ካብ ክልቲኡ እቲ Muslim እና እቲ -non-Muslim ድኻ ተጀሚሩ ብ Umar ibn al Khattab ዝነበረ እውን .continued 'Muawiya's ሰበይቲ Maysum ('Yazid's )ኣዶ ኔሩ እውን ሓደ .Christian እቲ relations አብ መንጎ እቲ Muslims እና እቲ Christians አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ግዝኣት ኔሮም ዝተረጋገአ አብ ውሽጢ እዚ .ግዜ እቲ Umayyads ኔሮም ዝተኻተተ አብ ውሽጢ ብተደጋጋሚ battles ምስ እቲ Christian Byzantines ብዘይካ ፍጥረት ዝሰገአ ምስ protecting ባዕሎም አብ ውሽጢ ,Syria አየናይ ዝነበረ remained largely Christian ምፍታው ቡዙሕ ካልእ parts ካብ እቲ .empire ጠቃሚ positions ኔሮም ተገይሩ ብ ,Christians ንእሽተይ ካብ መን belonged ናብ families እቲ ዝነበረ served አብ ውሽጢ Byzantine .governments እቲ ምቑጻር ስራሕ ካብ Christians ኔሩ ክፋል ካብ ሓደ broader ፖሊሲ ካብ ሃይማኖታዊ assimilation እቲ ኔሩ necessitated ብ እቲ ህላወ ካብ ገዚፍ Christian populations አብ ውሽጢ እቲ conquered ,provinces ከም አብ ውሽጢ .Syria እዚ ፖሊሲ እውን boosted 'Muawiya's popularity እና solidified Syria ከም ናቱ ሓይሊ .መሰረት",መን stated እቲ abrahamic ሃይማኖታዊ groups ይሓይሽ ኩን ተፈቂዱሉ ናብ ትግበራ ናቶም ወንን ?ሃይማኖት,Muhammad,Yazid,Syria,Christian
"The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as The Adventures of Tintin. American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (manga) propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka.

"By far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812. With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were more successful. After defeating Napoleon in 1814, Britain sent large veteran armies to invade New York, raid Washington and capture the key control of the Mississippi River at New Orleans. The New York invasion was a fiasco after the much larger British army retreated to Canada. The raiders succeeded in the burning of Washington on 25 August 1814, but were repulsed in their Chesapeake Bay Campaign at the Battle of Baltimore and the British commander killed. The major invasion in Louisiana was stopped by a one-sided military battle that killed the top three British generals and thousands of soldiers. The winners were the commanding general of the Battle of New Orleans, Major General Andrew Jackson, who became president and the Americans who basked in a victory over a much more powerful nation. The peace treaty proved successful, and the U.S. and Britain never again went to war. The losers were the Indians, who never gained the independent territory in the Midwest promised by Britain.",475,What war was the largest in which the United States engaged in?,Indians,Indian,the War of 1812,Midwest,3,"ብ ርሑቅ እቲ largest ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት ተግባር አብ ውሽጢ አየናይ እቲ United States ሕፁይ አብ እዋን እዚ era ኔሩ እቲ ውግእ ካብ .1812 ምስ Britain locked አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ዋና ውግእ ምስ 'Napoleon's ,France ናቱ ፖሊሲ ኔሩ ናብ ህንጻ American shipments ናብ .France እቲ United States ድሌት ናብ ምፅናሕ ግሉል እስካብ pursuing overseas .ንግዲ Britain ቁረፅ እቲ ንግዲ እና impressed seamen አብ ልዕሊ American ships ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ Royal ,Navy ብዘየገድስ ጽዑቕ .protests Britain supported ሓደ Indian insurrection አብ ውሽጢ እቲ American ,Midwest ምስ እቲ ሽቶ ካብ creating ሓደ Indian ግዝኣት ኣብቲ እቲ ይኸውን ህንጻ American .expansion እቲ United States ኣብ መወዳእታ declared ውግእ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ United Kingdom አብ ውሽጢ ,1812 እቲ መጀመርታ ግዜ እቲ ..U.S ዝነበረ officially declared .ውግእ ዘይኮነ hopeful ካብ defeating እቲ Royal ,Navy እቲ ..U.S attacked እቲ British Empire ብ invading British ,Canada hoping ናብ ጥቅሚ captured ግዝኣት ከም ሓደ bargaining .chip እቲ invasion ካብ Canada ኔሩ ሓደ ,debacle እኳ concurrent wars ምስ መበቆል Americans አብ ልዕሊ እቲ western ቅድሚት ('Tecumseh's ውግእ እና እቲ Creek )ውግእ ኔሮም ቡዙሕ .ዕውት ድሕሪ defeating Napoleon አብ ውሽጢ ,1814 Britain ተላኢኹ ገዚፍ veteran armies ናብ invade ሓድሽ ,York raid Washington እና ምሓዝ እቲ መፍትሕ ምቁጽጻር ካብ እቲ Mississippi ሩባ ኣብ ሓድሽ .Orleans እቲ ሓድሽ York invasion ኔሩ ሓደ fiasco ድሕሪ እቲ ብዙሕ larger British ሰራዊት retreated ናብ .Canada እቲ raiders succeeded አብ ውሽጢ እቲ burning ካብ Washington አብ ልዕሊ 25 ነሓሰ ,1814 ግን ኔሮም repulsed አብ ውሽጢ ናቶም Chesapeake ልሳን ባሕሪ ወፍሪ ኣብ እቲ ውግእ ካብ Baltimore እና እቲ British commander .killed እቲ ዋና invasion አብ ውሽጢ Louisiana ኔሩ stopped ብ ሓደ -one-sided ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት ውግእ እቲ killed እቲ ላዕለዋይ ሰለስተ British generals እና thousands ካብ .soldiers እቲ winners ኔሮም እቲ commanding ሓፈሻዊ ካብ እቲ ውግእ ካብ ሓድሽ ,Orleans ዋና ሓፈሻዊ Andrew ,Jackson መን ኮይኑ ፕረዝደንት እና እቲ Americans መን basked አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ victory ልዕሊ ሓደ ብዙሕ ቡዙሕ ሓያል .nation እቲ ሰላም treaty proved ,ዕውት እና እቲ ..U.S እና Britain ፍፁም ካልኣይ ኬዱ ናብ .ውግእ እቲ losers ኔሮም እቲ ,Indians መን ፍፁም gained እቲ ዓርሱ ዝኸኣለ ግዝኣት አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Midwest promised ብ .Britain",እንታይ ውግእ ኔሩ እቲ largest አብ ውሽጢ አየናይ እቲ United States ሕፁይ ?አብ ውሽጢ,Indians,Indian,እቲ ውግእ ካብ 1812,Midwest

"As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students.

"Pesticides are substances meant for attracting, seducing, and then destroying any pest. They are a class of biocide. The most common use of pesticides is as plant protection products (also known as crop protection products), which in general protect plants from damaging influences such as weeds, fungi, or insects. This use of pesticides is so common that the term pesticide is often treated as synonymous with plant protection product, although it is in fact a broader term, as pesticides are also used for non-agricultural purposes. The term pesticide includes all of the following: herbicide, insecticide, insect growth regulator, nematicide, termiticide, molluscicide, piscicide, avicide, rodenticide, predacide, bactericide, insect repellent, animal repellent, antimicrobial, fungicide, disinfectant (antimicrobial), and sanitizer.",484,"What substances are used to seduce, eat, and destroy pests?",pediculicide.n.01,pesticides,sheep dip.n.01,arsenical.n.01,2,"Pesticides እዮም substances ናይ ብሓቂ ን ,attracting ,seducing እና ሽዑ destroying ዝኾነ .pest ንሶም እዮም ሓደ ክፍሊ ካብ .biocide እቲ ብጥዕሚ ልሙድ ጥቅሚ ካብ pesticides እዩ ከም ተኽሊ protection products (እውን ፍሉጥ ከም እኽሊ protection ),products አየናይ አብ ውሽጢ ሓፈሻዊ ሓሉ ተኽልታት ካብ damaging influences ከምዚ ከም ,weeds ,fungi ወይ .insects እዚ ጥቅሚ ካብ pesticides እዩ ስለዚ ልሙድ እቲ እቲ ቃል pesticide እዩ ኩል ግዘ treated ከም synonymous ምስ ተኽሊ protection ,ፍርያት ዋላ እኳ እቲ ነገር እዩ አብ ውሽጢ ሓቂ ሓደ broader ,ቃል ከም pesticides እዮም እውን ዘገልገለ ን -non-agricultural .purposes እቲ ቃል pesticide includes ኩሎም ካብ እቲ :ምኽታል ,herbicide ,insecticide ሓሰኻ ዕቤት ,regulator ,nematicide ,termiticide ,molluscicide ,piscicide ,avicide ,rodenticide ,predacide ,bactericide ሓሰኻ ,repellent እንስሳ ,repellent ,antimicrobial ,fungicide disinfectant (),antimicrobial እና .sanitizer","እንታይ substances እዮም ዘገልገለ ናብ ,seduce ,ብላዕ እና ምጥፋእ ?pests",..pediculicide.n.01,pesticides,በጊዕ ..dip.n.01,..arsenical.n.01

"The roots of Presbyterianism lie in the European Reformation of the 16th century; the example of John Calvin's Geneva being particularly influential. Most Reformed churches which trace their history back to Scotland are either presbyterian or congregationalist in government. In the twentieth century, some Presbyterians played an important role in the ecumenical movement, including the World Council of Churches. Many Presbyterian denominations have found ways of working together with other Reformed denominations and Christians of other traditions, especially in the World Communion of Reformed Churches. Some Presbyterian churches have entered into unions with other churches, such as Congregationalists, Lutherans, Anglicans, and Methodists. Presbyterians in the United States came largely from Scotch-Irish immigrants communities, and also from New England Yankee communities that had originally been Congregational but changed because of an agreed-upon ""Plan of Union of 1801"" for frontier areas.",489,Whose Geneva became a significant influence for Presbyterianism?,Plan of Union of 1801,John Calvin's,Scotland,New England Yankee,2,"እቲ roots ካብ Presbyterianism ሓሶት አብ ውሽጢ እቲ European Reformation ካብ እቲ 16th ;ዘመን እቲ ኣብነት ካብ John 'Calvin's Geneva ፍጥረት ብፍላይ .influential ብጥዕሚ Reformed churches አየናይ ኣሰር ናቶም ታሪኽ ዝባን ናብ Scotland እዮም ወይ presbyterian ወይ congregationalist አብ ውሽጢ .መንግስቲ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ twentieth ,ዘመን ንእሽተይ Presbyterians played ሓደ ጠቃሚ ግደ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ecumenical ,ምንቅስቓስ ይሓውስ እቲ ዓለም ዋዕላ ካብ .Churches ቡዙሕ Presbyterian denominations ኣለኒ ተረኺቡ ways ካብ ምስራሕ ብሓባር ምስ ካልእ Reformed denominations እና Christians ካብ ካልእ ,traditions ብፍላይ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ዓለም Communion ካብ Reformed .Churches ንእሽተይ Presbyterian churches ኣለኒ entered ናብ ውሽጢ unions ምስ ካልእ ,churches ከምዚ ከም ,Congregationalists ,Lutherans ,Anglicans እና .Methodists Presbyterians አብ ውሽጢ እቲ United States መጺኡ largely ካብ -Scotch-Irish immigrants ,communities እና እውን ካብ ሓድሽ England Yankee communities እቲ ዝነበረ originally ዝነበረ Congregational ግን changed ምኽንያቱ ካብ ሓደ -agreed-upon ""ትልሚ ካብ Union ካብ ""1801 ን frontier .areas",ናይ መን Geneva ኮይኑ ሓደ ግዙፍ ተፅዕኖ ን ?Presbyterianism,ትልሚ ካብ Union ካብ 1801,John 'Calvin's,Scotland,ሓድሽ England Yankee

Most infections do not have symptoms, known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term ""consumption"" came about due to the weight loss.

"When the alloy cools and solidifies (crystallizes), its mechanical properties will often be quite different from those of its individual constituents. A metal that is normally very soft and malleable, such as aluminium, can be altered by alloying it with another soft metal, like copper. Although both metals are very soft and ductile, the resulting aluminium alloy will be much harder and stronger. Adding a small amount of non-metallic carbon to iron produces an alloy called steel. Due to its very-high strength and toughness (which is much higher than pure iron), and its ability to be greatly altered by heat treatment, steel is one of the most common alloys in modern use. By adding chromium to steel, its resistance to corrosion can be enhanced, creating stainless steel, while adding silicon will alter its electrical characteristics, producing silicon steel.",491,What type of metal can be altered by alloying aluminium with copper?,—,—,another soft metal,—,3,"መዓዝ እቲ alloy cools እና solidifies (),crystallizes ናቱ mechanical ኣቕሑት ንመፃእ ኩል ግዘ ኩን ፀጥ ዝበለ ፍሉይ ካብ እቲኦም ካብ ናቱ ውልቀ ሰብ .constituents ሓደ ሓጺን እቲ እዩ normally ብጣዕሚ ልስሉስ እና ,malleable ከምዚ ከም ,aluminium ይኽእል ኩን altered ብ alloying እቲ ነገር ምስ ካልእ ልስሉስ ,ሓጺን ምፍታው .ነሓስ ዋላ እኳ ክልቲኡ metals እዮም ብጣዕሚ ልስሉስ እና ,ductile እቲ resulting aluminium alloy ንመፃእ ኩን ብዙሕ harder እና .stronger Adding ሓደ ንኡስ መጠን ካብ -non-metallic carbon ናብ ሓፂን produces ሓደ alloy ዝተፀወዐ .ሓጺን መወዳእታ ናብ ናቱ -very-high ጥንካረ እና toughness (አየናይ እዩ ብዙሕ higher ካብ ፅሩይ ),ሓፂን እና ናቱ ተኽእሎ ናብ ኩን greatly altered ብ ሙቀት ,ህክምና ሓጺን እዩ ሓደ ካብ እቲ ብጥዕሚ ልሙድ alloys አብ ውሽጢ ዘበናዊ .ጥቅሚ ብ adding chromium ናብ ,ሓጺን ናቱ ተቓውሞ ናብ corrosion ይኽእል ኩን ,enhanced creating stainless ,ሓጺን እስካብ adding silicon ንመፃእ alter ናቱ electrical ,ባህርያት producing silicon .ሓጺን",እንታይ ዓይነት ካብ ሓጺን ይኽእል ኩን altered ብ alloying aluminium ምስ ?ነሓስ,—,—,ካልእ ልስሉስ ሓጺን,—

A series of such fortresses was built after the Roman emperor Claudius decided the empire should not expand north. To consolidate the border the limes Germanicus defense line was constructed  along the main branch of the river Rhine, which at that time flowed through a more northern bed compared to today (what is now the Kromme Rijn).

"Josip Broz Tito (Cyrillic: Јосип Броз Тито, pronounced [jǒsip brôːz tîto]; born Josip Broz; 7 May 1892[nb 1] – 4 May 1980) was a Yugoslav revolutionary and statesman, serving in various roles from 1943 until his death in 1980. During World War II he was the leader of the Partisans, often regarded as the most effective resistance movement in occupied Europe. While his presidency has been criticized as authoritarian, and concerns about the repression of political opponents have been raised, Tito was ""seen by most as a benevolent dictator"" due to his economic and diplomatic policies. He was a popular public figure both in Yugoslavia and abroad. Viewed as a unifying symbol, his internal policies maintained the peaceful coexistence of the nations of the Yugoslav federation.

"The term Cubism did not come into general usage until 1911, mainly with reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, and Léger. In 1911, the poet and critic Guillaume Apollinaire accepted the term on behalf of a group of artists invited to exhibit at the Brussels Indépendants. The following year, in preparation for the Salon de la Section d'Or, Metzinger and Gleizes wrote and published Du 'Cubisme' in an effort to dispel the confusion raging around the word, and as a major defence of Cubism (which had caused a public scandal following the 1911 Salon des Indépendants and the 1912 Salon d'Automne in Paris). Clarifying their aims as artists, this work was the first theoretical treatise on Cubism and it still remains the clearest and most intelligible. The result, not solely a collaboration between its two authors, reflected discussions by the circle of artists who met in Puteaux and Courbevoie. It mirrored the attitudes of the 'artists of Passy', which included Picabia and the Duchamp brothers, to whom sections of it were read prior to publication. The concept developed in Du 'Cubisme' of observing a subject from different points in space and time simultaneously, i.e., the act of moving around an object to seize it from several successive angles fused into a single image (multiple viewpoints, mobile perspective, simultaneity or multiplicity), is a generally recognized device used by the Cubists.",3,What is the main concept developed in Du 'Cubisme' according to the passage?,Using strong colors,Multiple viewpoints and simultaneity in perception,Sculpting in the round,Photorealism,2,"እቲ ቃል Cubism ግቡር ዘይኮነ ንዓ ናብ ውሽጢ ሓፈሻዊ usage ክሳብ ,1911 mainly ምስ መጣቀሲ ናብ ,Metzinger ,Gleizes ,Delaunay እና .Léger አብ ውሽጢ ,1911 እቲ poet እና critic Guillaume Apollinaire accepted እቲ ቃል አብ ልዕሊ ክንዲ ካብ ሓደ ጉጅለ ካብ artists invited ናብ ምርኢት ኣብ እቲ Brussels .Indépendants እቲ ምኽታል ,ዓመት አብ ውሽጢ ምድላው ን እቲ Salon de la ክፍሊ ',d'Or Metzinger እና Gleizes ጽሒፉ እና published Du ''Cubisme አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ፃዕሪ ናብ dispel እቲ ምድንጋራት raging አብ ከባቢ እቲ ,ቃል እና ከም ሓደ ዋና defence ካብ Cubism (አየናይ ዝነበረ caused ሓደ ህዝባዊ scandal ምኽታል እቲ 1911 Salon des Indépendants እና እቲ 1912 Salon 'd'Automne አብ ውሽጢ ).Paris Clarifying ናቶም aims ከም ,artists እዚ ስራሕ ኔሩ እቲ መጀመርታ theoretical treatise አብ ልዕሊ Cubism እና እቲ ነገር እስካብ ሕዚ remains እቲ clearest እና ብጥዕሚ .intelligible እቲ ,ውፅኢት ዘይኮነ solely ሓደ collaboration አብ መንጎ ናቱ ክልተ ,authors reflected discussions ብ እቲ ክቢ ካብ artists መን met አብ ውሽጢ Puteaux እና .Courbevoie እቲ ነገር mirrored እቲ attitudes ካብ እቲ 'artists ካብ ',Passy አየናይ included Picabia እና እቲ Duchamp ,brothers ናብ መን sections ካብ እቲ ነገር ኔሮም ኣንብብ ቅድሚያ ናብ .publication እቲ ጭብጢ ምዕቡል አብ ውሽጢ Du ''Cubisme ካብ observing ሓደ ዋና ካብ ፍሉይ points አብ ውሽጢ ቦታ እና ግዜ ,ብተኻታታሊ ..,i.e እቲ ፍፃመ ካብ moving አብ ከባቢ ሓደ ግኡዝ ነገር ናብ መንጠለ እቲ ነገር ካብ ቡዙሓት successive angles fused ናብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ነፀላ ስእሊ (multiple ,viewpoints ተንቀሳቓሲ ,ኣመለኻኽታ simultaneity ወይ ),multiplicity እዩ ሓደ ብሓፈሻ recognized መሳርሒ ዘገልገለ ብ እቲ .Cubists",እንታይ እዩ እቲ ዋና ጭብጢ ምዕቡል አብ ውሽጢ Du ''Cubisme ከም ናብ እቲ ?መሕለፊ,Using ጠንካራ colors,Multiple viewpoints እና simultaneity አብ ውሽጢ ናይ ምርዳእ ክእለት,Sculpting አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ዓንኬል,Photorealism
"In the 16th century the northern fringe of the Sahara, such as coastal regencies in present-day Algeria and Tunisia, as well as some parts of present-day Libya, together with the semi-autonomous kingdom of Egypt, were occupied by the Ottoman Empire. From 1517 Egypt was a valued part of the Ottoman Empire, ownership of which provided the Ottomans with control over the Nile Valley, the east Mediterranean and North Africa. The benefit of the Ottoman Empire was the freedom of movement for citizens and goods. Trade exploited the Ottoman land routes to handle the spices, gold and silk from the East, manufactures from Europe, and the slave and gold traffic from Africa. Arabic continued as the local language and Islamic culture was much reinforced.
