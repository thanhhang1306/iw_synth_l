"The World Bank reported in February 2009 that the Arab World was far less severely affected by the credit crunch. With generally good balance of payments positions coming into the crisis or with alternative sources of financing for their large current account deficits, such as remittances, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) or foreign aid, Arab countries were able to avoid going to the market in the latter part of 2008. This group is in the best position to absorb the economic shocks. They entered the crisis in exceptionally strong positions. This gives them a significant cushion against the global downturn. The greatest impact of the global economic crisis will come in the form of lower oil prices, which remains the single most important determinant of economic performance. Steadily declining oil prices would force them to draw down reserves and cut down on investments. Significantly lower oil prices could cause a reversal of economic performance as has been the case in past oil shocks. Initial impact will be seen on public finances and employment for foreign workers.",1,When did the World Bank report that the Arab world was less severely affected by the credit crunch?,FDI,Arab,February 2009,Foreign Direct Investment,3,"እቲ ዓለም ባንኪ reported አብ ውሽጢ ለካቲት 2009 እቲ እቲ Arab ዓለም ኔሩ ርሑቅ ዝወሓደ severely affected ብ እቲ ልቓሕ .crunch ምስ ብሓፈሻ ፅቡቅ ሚዛን ካብ payments positions ዝመጽእ ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ ቅልውላው ወይ ምስ ኣማራፂ sources ካብ financing ን ናቶም ገዚፍ እዋናዊ ኣካውንት ,deficits ከምዚ ከም ,remittances ናይ ወፃእ ቕጥታ Investment ()FDI ወይ ናይ ወፃእ ,ረድኤት Arab countries ኔሮም ምኽኣል ናብ አወግድ ከያዲ ናብ እቲ ዕዳጋ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ጸኒሑ ክፋል ካብ .2008 እዚ ጉጅለ እዩ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ምሩፅ ቦታ ናብ መጢጡ እቲ ቁጠባዊ .shocks ንሶም entered እቲ ቅልውላው አብ ውሽጢ exceptionally ጠንካራ .positions እዚ gives ንሶም ሓደ ግዙፍ መኽደኒ ተቃራኒ እቲ ዓለምለኻዊ .downturn እቲ greatest ፅልዋ ካብ እቲ ዓለምለኻዊ ቁጠባዊ ቅልውላው ንመፃእ ንዓ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ፎርም ካብ ታሕተዋይ ዘይቲ ,prices አየናይ remains እቲ ነፀላ ብጥዕሚ ጠቃሚ determinant ካብ ቁጠባዊ .ብቅዓት Steadily declining ዘይቲ prices ይኸውን ሓይሊ ንሶም ናብ ሰኣል ታሕቲ reserves እና ቁረፅ ታሕቲ አብ ልዕሊ .investments Significantly ታሕተዋይ ዘይቲ prices ይከኣል ጠንቂ ሓደ reversal ካብ ቁጠባዊ ብቅዓት ከም ኣለዎ ዝነበረ እቲ ጉዳይ አብ ውሽጢ ሕሉፍ ዘይቲ .shocks መጀመሪ ፅልዋ ንመፃእ ኩን ተራእዩ አብ ልዕሊ ህዝባዊ finances እና ምቑጻር ስራሕ ን ናይ ወፃእ .workers",መዓዝ ግቡር እቲ ዓለም ባንኪ ኣፍልጥ እቲ እቲ Arab ዓለም ኔሩ ዝወሓደ severely affected ብ እቲ ልቓሕ ?crunch,FDI,Arab,ለካቲት 2009,ናይ ወፃእ ቕጥታ Investment

"Valencia is a bilingual city: Valencian and Spanish are the two official languages. Spanish is official in all of Spain, whereas Valencian is official in the Valencian Country, as well as in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands, where it receives the name of Catalan. Despite the differentiated denomination, the distinct dialectal traits and political tension between Catalonia and the Valencian Country, Catalan and Valencian are mutually intelligible and are considered two varieties of the same language.
Valencian has been historically repressed in favour of Spanish. The effects have been more noticeable in the city proper, whereas the language has remained active in the rural and metropolitan areas. After the Castille-Aragon unification, a Spanish-speaking elite established itself in the city. In more recent history, the establishment of Franco's military and administrative apparatus in Valencia further excluded Valencian from public life. Valencian recovered its official status, prestige and use in education after the transition to democracy in 1978. However, due to industrialisation in recent decades, Valencia has attracted immigration from other regions in Spain, and hence there is also a demographic factor for its declining social use. Due to a combination of these reasons, Valencia has become the bastion of anti-Catalan blaverism, which celebrates Valencian as merely folkloric, but rejects the existing standard which was adapted from Catalan orthography.
Spanish is currently the predominant language in the city proper but, thanks to the education system, most Valencians have basic knowledge of both Spanish and Valencian, and either can be used in the city. Valencia is therefore the second biggest Catalan-speaking city after Barcelona. Institutional buildings and streets are named in Valencian. The city is also home to many pro-Valencian political and civil organisations. Furthermore, education entirely in Valencian is offered in more than 70 state-owned schools in the city, as well as by the University of Valencia across all disciplines.",8,Which city is bilingual?,recent decades,two,more than 70,Valencia,4,"Valencia እዩ ሓደ bilingual :ከተማ Valencian እና ስጳኛ እዮም እቲ ክልተ ዘፍለጠ .languages ስጳኛ እዩ ዘፍለጠ አብ ውሽጢ ኩሎም ካብ ,Spain ክኸውን ከሎ Valencian እዩ ዘፍለጠ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Valencian ,ሃገር ከም ደሓን ከም አብ ውሽጢ Catalonia እና እቲ Balearic ,Islands አበይ እቲ ነገር receives እቲ ሽም ካብ .Catalan ብዘየገድስ እቲ differentiated ,denomination እቲ ዝጠፈአ dialectal ባህርያት እና political ውጥረት አብ መንጎ Catalonia እና እቲ Valencian ,ሃገር Catalan እና Valencian እዮም mutually intelligible እና እዮም ገምገመ ክልተ varieties ካብ እቲ ማዕረ .ቋንቋ Valencian ኣለዎ ዝነበረ historically repressed አብ ውሽጢ ፍትወት ካብ .ስጳኛ እቲ effects ኣለኒ ዝነበረ ቡዙሕ noticeable አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ከተማ ,ቅቡል ክኸውን ከሎ እቲ ቋንቋ ኣለዎ remained ንቑሕ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ከባቢ ገጠር እና metropolitan .areas ድሕሪ እቲ -Castille-Aragon ,unification ሓደ -Spanish-speaking elite ዝተመስረተ itself አብ ውሽጢ እቲ .ከተማ አብ ውሽጢ ቡዙሕ ናይ ቀረባ ,ታሪኽ እቲ establishment ካብ 'Franco's ወተሃደራዊ ኣገልግሎት እና administrative apparatus አብ ውሽጢ Valencia ርሑቅ excluded Valencian ካብ ህዝባዊ .ህይወት Valencian recovered ናቱ ዘፍለጠ ,ኩነታት prestige እና ጥቅሚ አብ ውሽጢ ትምህርቲ ድሕሪ እቲ መሰጋገሪ ናብ ዲሞክራሲ አብ ውሽጢ .1978 ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ መወዳእታ ናብ industrialisation አብ ውሽጢ ናይ ቀረባ ,decades Valencia ኣለዎ attracted immigration ካብ ካልእ regions አብ ውሽጢ ,Spain እና በዚ ምኽንያት ኣብቲ እዩ እውን ሓደ demographic ረቛሒ ን ናቱ declining ማሕበራዊ .ጥቅሚ መወዳእታ ናብ ሓደ ጥምረት ካብ እዚ ,reasons Valencia ኣለዎ ምዃን እቲ bastion ካብ -anti-Catalan ,blaverism አየናይ celebrates Valencian ከም ጥራሕ ,folkloric ግን rejects እቲ ነባር መለክዒ አየናይ ኔሩ adapted ካብ Catalan .orthography ስጳኛ እዩ አብዚ ሕዚ እቲ predominant ቋንቋ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ከተማ ቅቡል ,ግን የቅንየለይ ናብ እቲ ትምህርቲ ,ስርዓት ብጥዕሚ Valencians ኣለኒ መሰረታዊ ፍልጠት ካብ ክልቲኡ ስጳኛ እና ,Valencian እና ወይ ይኽእል ኩን ዘገልገለ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ .ከተማ Valencia እዩ ስለዚ ድማ እቲ ካልኣይ biggest -Catalan-speaking ከተማ ድሕሪ .Barcelona Institutional buildings እና streets እዮም named አብ ውሽጢ .Valencian እቲ ከተማ እዩ እውን ገዛ ናብ ቡዙሕ -pro-Valencian political እና civil .organisations ,ካብዚ ተወሳኺ ትምህርቲ entirely አብ ውሽጢ Valencian እዩ offered አብ ውሽጢ ቡዙሕ ካብ 70 -state-owned schools አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ,ከተማ ከም ደሓን ከም ብ እቲ ዩኒቨርሲቲ ካብ Valencia ሰገር ኩሎም .disciplines",አየናይ ከተማ እዩ ?bilingual,ናይ ቀረባ decades,ክልተ,ቡዙሕ ካብ 70,Valencia
"The concept of 'education through recreation' was applied to childhood development in the 19th century. In the early 20th century, the concept was broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities. L.P. Jacks, also an early proponent of lifelong learning, described education through recreation: ""A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself he always seems to be doing both. Enough for him that he does it well."" Education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of life's activities.

"In nature, the red color of blood comes from hemoglobin, the iron-containing protein found in the red blood cells of all vertebrates. The red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide. It also causes the red color of the planet Mars. The red sky at sunset and sunrise is caused by an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering, which, when the sun is low or below the horizon, increases the red-wavelength light that reaches the eye. The color of autumn leaves is caused by pigments called anthocyanins, which are produced towards the end of summer, when the green chlorophyll is no longer produced. One to two percent of the human population has red hair; the color is produced by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin (which also accounts for the red color of the lips) and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin.",13,What optical effect causes the sky to be red when the sun is low or below the horizon?,Mars,the Grand Canyon,the end of summer,Rayleigh scatteri,4,"አብ ውሽጢ ,ተፈጥሮ እቲ ቀይሕ ሕብሪ ካብ ደም comes ካብ ,hemoglobin እቲ -iron-containing protein ተረኺቡ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ቀይሕ ደም cells ካብ ኩሎም .vertebrates እቲ ቀይሕ ሕብሪ ካብ እቲ Grand Canyon እና ካልእ geological መለለይታት እዩ caused ብ hematite ወይ ቀይሕ ,ochre ክልቲኡ forms ካብ ሓፂን .oxide እቲ ነገር እውን causes እቲ ቀይሕ ሕብሪ ካብ እቲ planet .Mars እቲ ቀይሕ ሰማይ ኣብ ጸሓይ ዕራርቦ እና sunrise እዩ caused ብ ሓደ optical ፅልዋ ፍሉጥ ከም Rayleigh ,scattering ,አየናይ መዓዝ እቲ ፀሓይ እዩ ውሑድ ወይ ትሕቲ እቲ ,horizon increases እቲ -red-wavelength ብርሃን እቲ reaches እቲ .ዓይኒ እቲ ሕብሪ ካብ ፅድያ ኣቑጽልቲ እዩ caused ብ pigments ዝተፀወዐ ,anthocyanins አየናይ እዮም produced ናብ ገፅ እቲ መወዳእታ ካብ ,ክረምቲ መዓዝ እቲ ቆፅለዋይ chlorophyll እዩ አይኮንን longer .produced ሓደ ናብ ክልተ percent ካብ እቲ ሰብ በዝሒ ህዝቢ ኣለዎ ቀይሕ ;ፀጉሪ እቲ ሕብሪ እዩ produced ብ ላዕሊ levels ካብ እቲ reddish pigment pheomelanin (አየናይ እውን accounts ን እቲ ቀይሕ ሕብሪ ካብ እቲ )lips እና relatively ውሑድ levels ካብ እቲ ፀልማት pigment .eumelanin",እንታይ optical ፅልዋ causes እቲ ሰማይ ናብ ኩን ቀይሕ መዓዝ እቲ ፀሓይ እዩ ውሑድ ወይ ትሕቲ እቲ ?horizon,Mars,እቲ Grand Canyon,እቲ መወዳእታ ካብ ክረምቲ,Rayleigh scatteri

"Groove recordings, first designed in the final quarter of the 19th century, held a predominant position for nearly a century—withstanding competition from reel-to-reel tape, the 8-track cartridge, and the compact cassette. In 1988, the compact disc surpassed the gramophone record in unit sales. Vinyl records experienced a sudden decline in popularity between 1988 and 1991, when the major label distributors restricted their return policies, which retailers had been relying on to maintain and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles. First the distributors began charging retailers more for new product if they returned unsold vinyl, and then they stopped providing any credit at all for returns. Retailers, fearing they would be stuck with anything they ordered, only ordered proven, popular titles that they knew would sell, and devoted more shelf space to CDs and cassettes. Record companies also deleted many vinyl titles from production and distribution, further undermining the availability of the format and leading to the closure of pressing plants. This rapid decline in the availability of records accelerated the format's decline in popularity, and is seen by some as a deliberate ploy to make consumers switch to CDs, which were more profitable for the record companies.",17,How long were Groove recordings on shelves?,nearly a century,8,first,First,1,"Groove ,recordings መጀመርታ designed አብ ውሽጢ እቲ final ርብዒ ካብ እቲ 19th ,ዘመን ተገይሩ ሓደ predominant ቦታ ን ከባቢ ሓደ century—withstanding ውድድር ካብ --reel-to-reel ,ካሴት እቲ -8-track ,cartridge እና እቲ compact .cassette አብ ውሽጢ ,1988 እቲ compact disc surpassed እቲ gramophone ቅዳሕ አብ ውሽጢ ምዕራፍ .sales Vinyl records experienced ሓደ ኣጋጣሚ ኣውድቅ አብ ውሽጢ popularity አብ መንጎ 1988 እና ,1991 መዓዝ እቲ ዋና መፍለዪ distributors restricted ናቶም ተመለስ ,policies አየናይ retailers ዝነበረ ዝነበረ relying አብ ልዕሊ ናብ ምዕቃብ እና ምልውዋጥ ደገ stocks ካብ relatively unpopular .titles መጀመርታ እቲ distributors ጀሚሩ charging retailers ቡዙሕ ን ሓድሽ ፍርያት እንተ ንሶም returned unsold ,vinyl እና ሽዑ ንሶም stopped providing ዝኾነ ልቓሕ ኣብ ኩሎም ን .returns ,Retailers fearing ንሶም ይኸውን ኩን ዝለገበ ምስ ምንም ነገር ንሶም ,ordered ጥራሕ ordered ,proven ህቡብ titles እቲ ንሶም ፈለጠ ይኸውን ,ሽጥ እና ውፉይ ቡዙሕ ስካፋለ ቦታ ናብ CDs እና .cassettes ቅዳሕ companies እውን deleted ቡዙሕ vinyl titles ካብ ምህርቲ እና ,ምክፍፋል ርሑቅ undermining እቲ availability ካብ እቲ format እና leading ናብ እቲ closure ካብ pressing .ተኽልታት እዚ ቕልጡፍ ኣውድቅ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ availability ካብ records accelerated እቲ 'format's ኣውድቅ አብ ውሽጢ ,popularity እና እዩ ተራእዩ ብ ንእሽተይ ከም ሓደ ጥንቁቕ ploy ናብ ስራሕ consumers ለውጥ ናብ ,CDs አየናይ ኔሮም ቡዙሕ profitable ን እቲ ቅዳሕ .companies",ከመይ ነዊሕ ኔሮም Groove recordings አብ ልዕሊ ?shelves,ከባቢ ሓደ ዘመን,8,መጀመርታ,መጀመርታ

"At the beginning of the Caliphate or Islamic Empire, the reliance on courts initially confined sponsorship and scholarly activities to major centres. Within several centuries, the development of Muslim educational institutions such as the madrasah and masjid eventually introduced such activities to provincial towns and dispersed them across the Islamic legal schools and Sufi orders. In addition to religious subjects, they also taught the ""rational sciences,"" as varied as mathematics, astronomy, astrology, geography, alchemy, philosophy, magic, and occultism, depending on the curriculum of the specific institution in question. The madaris, however, were not centres of advanced scientific study; scientific advances in Islam were usually carried out by scholars working under the patronage of royal courts. During this time,[when?] the Caliphate experienced a growth in literacy, having the highest literacy rate of the Middle Ages, comparable to classical Athens' literacy in antiquity but on a much larger scale. The emergence of the maktab and madrasa institutions played a fundamental role in the relatively high literacy rates of the medieval Islamic world.",19,How long did it take for the Islamic kingdom to expand?,Sufi,several centuries,Caliphate,Athens,2,"ኣብ እቲ መጀመርታ ካብ እቲ Caliphate ወይ Islamic ,Empire እቲ reliance አብ ልዕሊ courts initially confined sponsorship እና scholarly ስራሕቲ ናብ ዋና .centres አብ ውሽጢ ቡዙሓት ,centuries እቲ ዕብየት ካብ Muslim educational institutions ከምዚ ከም እቲ madrasah እና masjid ብኽይዲ introduced ከምዚ ስራሕቲ ናብ provincial towns እና dispersed ንሶም ሰገር እቲ Islamic ሕጋዊ schools እና Sufi .orders አብ ውሽጢ ተወሳኺ ናብ ሃይማኖታዊ ,subjects ንሶም እውን ዝተመሃረ እቲ ""ርትዓዊ ,""sciences ከም varied ከም ,mathematics ,astronomy ,astrology ,geography ,alchemy ,ፍልስፍና ,magic እና ,occultism depending አብ ልዕሊ እቲ curriculum ካብ እቲ ዝተወሰነ institution አብ ውሽጢ .ሕቶ እቲ ,madaris ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ኔሮም ዘይኮነ centres ካብ ዝተመሓየሸ scientific ;መፅናዕቲ scientific advances አብ ውሽጢ Islam ኔሮም ብልሙድ carried ደገ ብ scholars ምስራሕ ትሕቲ እቲ patronage ካብ royal .courts አብ እዋን እዚ ,[?]time,[when እቲ Caliphate experienced ሓደ ዕቤት አብ ውሽጢ ,literacy ምህላው እቲ highest literacy መደብ ካብ እቲ ማእኸል ,Ages comparable ናብ classical 'Athens literacy አብ ውሽጢ antiquity ግን አብ ልዕሊ ሓደ ብዙሕ larger .መለክዒ እቲ emergence ካብ እቲ maktab እና madrasa institutions played ሓደ መሰረታዊ ግደ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ relatively ላዕሊ literacy rates ካብ እቲ medieval Islamic .ዓለም",ከመይ ነዊሕ ግቡር እቲ ነገር ውሰድ ን እቲ Islamic kingdom ናብ ?ምስፍሕፋሕ,Sufi,ቡዙሓት centuries,Caliphate,Athens

"Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to ""purge the ministry of Jews."" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's ""modus operandi"" was ""more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan."" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany, but rather was Stalin's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man, namely Molotov, to the Foreign Commissariat. Historian Albert Resis stated that the Litvinov dismissal gave the Soviets freedom to pursue faster-paced German negotiations, but that they did not abandon British–French talks. Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with Germany. Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov's dismissal helped the Soviets with British–French talks, because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions.",21,"Who directed Molotov to ""purge the ministry of Jews?""",One,Geoffrey Roberts,Stalin,British,3,"ብዛዕባ እቲ timing ካብ German ,rapprochement ቡዙሕ historians ተስማዕማዕ እቲ እቲ dismissal ካብ Maxim ,Litvinov ናይ መን Jewish ethnicity ኔሩ viewed unfavorably ብ Nazi ,Germany removed ሓደ ዕንቅፋት ናብ negotiations ምስ .Germany Stalin ብቀጥታ directed Molotov ናብ ""purge እቲ ministry ካብ .""Jews ዝተወሃበ 'Litvinov's ቅድሚያ attempts ናብ ፍጠር ሓደ -anti-fascist ,coalition ማሕበር ምስ እቲ doctrine ካብ collective ድሕንነት ምስ France እና ,Britain እና -pro-Western ኣንፈት ብ እቲ standards ካብ እቲ ,Kremlin ናቱ dismissal indicated እቲ ህላወ ካብ ሓደ Soviet መማረጺ ካብ rapprochement ምስ .[]Germany.[f ,ከምኡውን 'Molotov's ቆፀራ served ከም ሓደ signal ናብ Germany እቲ እቲ USSR ኔሩ ክፈት ናብ .offers እቲ dismissal እውን signaled ናብ France እና Britain እቲ ህላወ ካብ ሓደ ውሽጣዊ ዓቅሚ negotiation መማረጺ ምስ .Germany ሓደ British ዘፍለጠ ጽሒፉ እቲ 'Litvinov's disappearance እውን ናይ ብሓቂ እቲ ምስኣን ካብ ሓደ admirable technician ወይ -,shock-absorber እስካብ 'Molotov's ""modus ""operandi ኔሩ ""ቡዙሕ truly Bolshevik ካብ diplomatic ወይ .""cosmopolitan Carr argued እቲ እቲ Soviet 'Union's replacement ካብ ናይ ወፃእ Minister Litvinov ምስ Molotov አብ ልዕሊ ተዝኸዉን ,3 1939 indicated ዘይኮነ ሓደ irrevocable ምቕያር ናብ ገፅ alignment ምስ ,Germany ግን ይመርፅ ኔሩ 'Stalin's መንገዲ ካብ engaging አብ ውሽጢ ከቢድ bargaining ምስ እቲ British እና እቲ French ብ appointing ሓደ proverbial ከቢድ ,ሰብኣይ namely ,Molotov ናብ እቲ ናይ ወፃእ .Commissariat Historian Albert Resis stated እቲ እቲ Litvinov dismissal ሂቡ እቲ Soviets ነፃነት ናብ ክትትል -faster-paced German ,negotiations ግን እቲ ንሶም ግቡር ዘይኮነ ኣቋረፀ British–French .talks Derek Watson argued እቲ Molotov ይከኣል ምርካብ እቲ ምሩፅ ዛዕባ ምስ Britain እና France ምኽንያቱ ንሱ ኔሩ ዘይኮነ encumbered ምስ እቲ baggage ካብ collective ድሕንነት እና ይከኣል ምስምዕማዕ ምስ .Germany Geoffrey Roberts argued እቲ 'Litvinov's dismissal helped እቲ Soviets ምስ British–French ,talks ምኽንያቱ Litvinov doubted ወይ ምናልባት ሙሉእ opposed ከምዚ .discussions","መን directed Molotov ናብ ""purge እቲ ministry ካብ ?""Jews",ሓደ,Geoffrey Roberts,Stalin,British

The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch.

"Washington University has over 300 undergraduate student organizations on campus. Most are funded by the Washington University Student Union, which has a $2 million plus annual budget that is completely student-controlled and is one of the largest student government budgets in the country. Known as SU for short, the Student Union sponsors large-scale campus programs including WILD (a semesterly concert in the quad) and free copies of the New York Times, USA Today, and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch through The Collegiate Readership Program; it also contributes to the Assembly Series, a weekly lecture series produced by the University, and funds the campus television station, WUTV, and the radio station, KWUR. KWUR was named best radio station in St. Louis of 2003 by the Riverfront Times despite the fact that its signal reaches only a few blocks beyond the boundaries of the campus. There are 11 fraternities and 9 sororities, with approximately 35% of the student body being involved in Greek life.

"A study of haplotypes of the Y-chromosome, published in 2000, addressed the paternal origins of Ashkenazi Jews. Hammer et al. found that the Y-chromosome of Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews contained mutations that are also common among Middle Eastern peoples, but uncommon in the general European population. This suggested that the male ancestors of the Ashkenazi Jews could be traced mostly to the Middle East. The proportion of male genetic admixture in Ashkenazi Jews amounts to less than 0.5% per generation over an estimated 80 generations, with ""relatively minor contribution of European Y chromosomes to the Ashkenazim,"" and a total admixture estimate ""very similar to Motulsky's average estimate of 12.5%."" This supported the finding that ""Diaspora Jews from Europe, Northwest Africa, and the Near East resemble each other more closely than they resemble their non-Jewish neighbors.""

"Evolutionary ideas, although not natural selection, were accepted by German biologists accustomed to ideas of homology in morphology from Goethe's Metamorphosis of Plants and from their long tradition of comparative anatomy. Bronn's alterations in his German translation added to the misgivings of conservatives, but enthused political radicals. Ernst Haeckel was particularly ardent, aiming to synthesise Darwin's ideas with those of Lamarck and Goethe while still reflecting the spirit of Naturphilosophie. Their ambitious programme to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life was joined by Huxley and supported by discoveries in palaeontology. Haeckel used embryology extensively in his recapitulation theory, which embodied a progressive, almost linear model of evolution. Darwin was cautious about such histories, and had already noted that von Baer's laws of embryology supported his idea of complex branching.",33,Who was especially ardent about synthesising Darwin's ideas with Lamarck and Goethe?,Lamarck,Darwin,Bronn,Ernst Haeckel,4,"Evolutionary ,ideas ዋላ እኳ ዘይኮነ ተፈጥራዊ ,selection ኔሮም accepted ብ German biologists accustomed ናብ ideas ካብ homology አብ ውሽጢ morphology ካብ 'Goethe's Metamorphosis ካብ ተኽልታት እና ካብ ናቶም ነዊሕ ልምዲ ካብ comparative .anatomy 'Bronn's alterations አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ German translation added ናብ እቲ misgivings ካብ ,conservatives ግን enthused political .radicals Ernst Haeckel ኔሩ ብፍላይ ,ardent aiming ናብ synthesise 'Darwin's ideas ምስ እቲኦም ካብ Lamarck እና Goethe እስካብ እስካብ ሕዚ reflecting እቲ መንፈስ ካብ .Naturphilosophie ናቶም ፃምእ ዓወት ዘለዎ programme ናብ reconstruct እቲ evolutionary ታሪኽ ካብ ህይወት ኔሩ joined ብ Huxley እና supported ብ discoveries አብ ውሽጢ .palaeontology Haeckel ዘገልገለ embryology extensively አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ recapitulation ,ሓሳብ አየናይ embodied ሓደ ,progressive ዳርጋ linear መርኣያ ካብ .ደፋእታዊ ለውጢ Darwin ኔሩ ጥንቁቕ ብዝዕባ ከምዚ ,histories እና ዝነበረ ክውን ተመዝጊቡ እቲ von 'Baer's laws ካብ embryology supported ናቱ ሓሳብ ካብ ሕውስዋስ .branching",መን ኔሩ ብፍላይ ardent ብዝዕባ synthesising 'Darwin's ideas ምስ Lamarck እና ?Goethe,Lamarck,Darwin,Bronn,Ernst Haeckel

According to Nevill (citing the historian Sir Edward Creasy), what Wellington said, while passing an Eton cricket match many decades later, was, ""There grows the stuff that won Waterloo"", a remark Nevill construes as a reference to ""the manly character induced by games and sport"" amongst English youth generally, not a comment about Eton specifically.

"In the early 5th century, the deep crisis suffered by the Roman Empire allowed different tribes of Central Europe (Suebi, Vandals and Alani) to cross the Rhine and penetrate into the rule on 31 December 406. Its progress towards the Iberian Peninsula forced the Roman authorities to establish a treaty (foedus) by which the Suebi would settle peacefully and govern Galicia as imperial allies. So, from 409 Galicia was taken by the Suebi, forming the first medieval kingdom to be created in Europe, in 411, even before the fall of the Roman Empire, being also the first Germanic kingdom to mint coinage in Roman lands. During this period a Briton colony and bishopric (see Mailoc) was established in Northern Galicia (Britonia), probably as foederati and allies of the Suebi. In 585, the Visigothic King Leovigild invaded the Suebic kingdom of Galicia and defeated it, bringing it under Visigoth control.",37,When did different tribes from Central Europe cross the Rhine?,31 December 406,Suebi,Britonia,Suebic,1,"አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ብግዘ 5th ,ዘመን እቲ ጥሉቅ ቅልውላው suffered ብ እቲ Roman Empire ተፈቂዱሉ ፍሉይ tribes ካብ Central Europe (,Suebi Vandals እና )Alani ናብ መስቀል እቲ Rhine እና penetrate ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ ስርዓት አብ ልዕሊ 31 ታሕሳስ .406 ናቱ ምዕባለ ናብ ገፅ እቲ Iberian Peninsula forced እቲ Roman authorities ናብ መስርት ሓደ treaty ()foedus ብ አየናይ እቲ Suebi ይኸውን ተስማዕመዐ peacefully እና govern Galicia ከም imperial .allies ,ስለዚ ካብ 409 Galicia ኔሩ ተወሲዱ ብ እቲ ,Suebi forming እቲ መጀመርታ medieval kingdom ናብ ኩን created አብ ውሽጢ ,Europe አብ ውሽጢ ,411 ሙሉእ ቅድሚ እቲ ምውዳቅ ካብ እቲ Roman ,Empire ፍጥረት እውን እቲ መጀመርታ Germanic kingdom ናብ mint coinage አብ ውሽጢ Roman .lands አብ እዋን እዚ ግዘ ሓደ Briton colony እና bishopric (ረአ )Mailoc ኔሩ ዝተመስረተ አብ ውሽጢ Northern Galicia (),Britonia ናይ ምዃን ዕድል ከም foederati እና allies ካብ እቲ .Suebi አብ ውሽጢ ,585 እቲ Visigothic ንጉስ Leovigild invaded እቲ Suebic kingdom ካብ Galicia እና defeated ,እቲ ነገር bringing እቲ ነገር ትሕቲ Visigoth .ምቁጽጻር",መዓዝ ግቡር ፍሉይ tribes ካብ Central Europe መስቀል እቲ ?Rhine,31 ታሕሳስ 406,Suebi,Britonia,Suebic

"In 1839, Melbourne resigned after Radicals and Tories (both of whom Victoria detested) voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of Jamaica. The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery. The Queen commissioned a Tory, Sir Robert Peel, to form a new ministry. At the time, it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household, who were usually his political allies and their spouses. Many of the Queen's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs, and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories. In what became known as the bedchamber crisis, Victoria, advised by Melbourne, objected to their removal. Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen, and consequently resigned his commission, allowing Melbourne to return to office.",39,When did Melbourne resign?,Tories,Peel,Tory,1839,4,"አብ ውሽጢ ,1839 Melbourne resigned ድሕሪ Radicals እና Tories (ክልቲኡ ካብ መን Victoria )detested voted ተቃራኒ ሓደ ክፍሊት ናብ suspend እቲ constitution ካብ .Jamaica እቲ ክፍሊት removed political ሓይሊ ካብ plantation owners መን ኔሮም resisting ይዕቅን ተሓባበረ ምስ እቲ abolition ካብ .slavery እቲ ንግስቲ commissioned ሓደ ,Tory ሃለቃ Robert ,ምልሓፅ ናብ ፎርም ሓደ ሓድሽ .ministry ኣብ እቲ ,ግዜ እቲ ነገር ኔሩ customary ን እቲ ቀዳማይ minister ናብ appoint members ካብ እቲ Royal ,ስድራ ቤት መን ኔሮም ብልሙድ ናቱ political allies እና ናቶም .spouses ቡዙሕ ካብ እቲ 'Queen's ladies ካብ እቲ bedchamber ኔሮም wives ካብ ,Whigs እና ምልሓፅ ዝፅበ ናብ ምትካእ ንሶም ምስ wives ካብ .Tories አብ ውሽጢ እንታይ ኮይኑ ፍሉጥ ከም እቲ bedchamber ,ቅልውላው ,Victoria advised ብ ,Melbourne objected ናብ ናቶም .removal ምልሓፅ ዝተኸለአ ናብ govern ትሕቲ እቲ restrictions imposed ብ እቲ ,ንግስቲ እና consequently resigned ናቱ ,ኮምሽን allowing Melbourne ናብ ተመለስ ናብ .ቤት-ፅሕፈት",መዓዝ ግቡር Melbourne ?ካብ ስራሕ ተባረረ,Tories,ምልሓፅ,Tory,1839
"Luminous efficacy of a light source may be defined in two ways. The radiant luminous efficacy (LER) is the ratio of the visible light flux emitted (the luminous flux) to the total power radiated over all wavelengths. The source luminous efficacy (LES) is the ratio of the visible light flux emitted (the luminous flux) to the total power input to the source, such as a lamp. Visible light is measured in lumens, a unit which is defined in part by the differing sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of light. Not all wavelengths of visible electromagnetic energy are equally effective at stimulating the human eye; the luminous efficacy of radiant energy (LER) is a measure of how well the distribution of energy matches the perception of the eye. The units of luminous efficacy are ""lumens per watt"" (lpw). The maximum LER possible is 683 lm/W for monochromatic green light at 555 nanometers wavelength, the peak sensitivity of the human eye.",40,How many ways is the Luminous efficacy of a light source defined?,two,LER,LES,craps.n.01,1,"Luminous efficacy ካብ ሓደ ብርሃን ፍልፍል ተዝኸዉን ኩን defined አብ ውሽጢ ክልተ .ways እቲ radiant luminous efficacy ()LER እዩ እቲ መጠነ ዝምድና ካብ እቲ visible ብርሃን flux emitted (እቲ luminous )flux ናብ እቲ ድምር ሓይሊ radiated ልዕሊ ኩሎም .wavelengths እቲ ፍልፍል luminous efficacy ()LES እዩ እቲ መጠነ ዝምድና ካብ እቲ visible ብርሃን flux emitted (እቲ luminous )flux ናብ እቲ ድምር ሓይሊ input ናብ እቲ ,ፍልፍል ከምዚ ከም ሓደ .መብራህቲ Visible ብርሃን እዩ measured አብ ውሽጢ ,lumens ሓደ ምዕራፍ አየናይ እዩ defined አብ ውሽጢ ክፋል ብ እቲ differing sensitivity ካብ እቲ ሰብ ዓይኒ ናብ ፍሉይ wavelengths ካብ .ብርሃን ዘይኮነ ኩሎም wavelengths ካብ visible electromagnetic ጉልበት እዮም equally ውፅኢታዊ ኣብ stimulating እቲ ሰብ ;ዓይኒ እቲ luminous efficacy ካብ radiant ጉልበት ()LER እዩ ሓደ ለክዕ ካብ ከመይ ደሓን እቲ ምክፍፋል ካብ ጉልበት matches እቲ ናይ ምርዳእ ክእለት ካብ እቲ .ዓይኒ እቲ units ካብ luminous efficacy እዮም ""lumens per ""watt ().lpw እቲ maximum LER ዝከኣል እዩ 683 /lm/W ን monochromatic ቆፅለዋይ ብርሃን ኣብ 555 nanometers ,wavelength እቲ ጫፍ sensitivity ካብ እቲ ሰብ .ዓይኒ",ከመይ ቡዙሕ ways እዩ እቲ Luminous efficacy ካብ ሓደ ብርሃን ፍልፍል ?defined,ክልተ,LER,LES,..craps.n.01
"The Soviet request to join NATO arose in the aftermath of the Berlin Conference of January–February 1954. Soviet foreign minister Molotov made proposals to have Germany reunified and elections for a pan-German government, under conditions of withdrawal of the four powers armies and German neutrality, but all were refused by the other foreign ministers, Dulles (USA), Eden (UK) and Bidault (France). Proposals for the reunification of Germany were nothing new: earlier on 20 March 1952, talks about a German reunification, initiated by the socalled 'Stalin Note', ended after the United Kingdom, France, and the United States insisted that a unified Germany should not be neutral and should be free to join the European Defence Community and rearm. James Dunn (USA), who met in Paris with Eden, Adenauer and Robert Schuman (France), affirmed that ""the object should be to avoid discussion with the Russians and to press on the European Defense Community"". According to John Gaddis ""there was little inclination in Western capitals to explore this offer"" from USSR. While historian Rolf Steininger asserts that Adenauer's conviction that “neutralization means sovietization” was the main factor in the rejection of the soviet proposals, Adenauer also feared that unification might have resulted in the end of the CDU's dominance in the Bundestag.",41,What country requested joining NATO after the Berlin Conference?,James Dunn,Soviet,CDU,Adenauer,2,"እቲ Soviet ሕተት ናብ ተሓወስ NATO arose አብ ውሽጢ እቲ aftermath ካብ እቲ Berlin ዋዕላ ካብ January–February .1954 Soviet ናይ ወፃእ minister Molotov ዝተሰርሐ proposals ናብ ኣለኒ Germany reunified እና elections ን ሓደ -pan-German ,መንግስቲ ትሕቲ ኩነታት ካብ ወጻኢ ምግባር ካብ እቲ ዓርባዕተ powers armies እና German ,neutrality ግን ኩሎም ኔሮም ዝተኸለአ ብ እቲ ካልእ ናይ ወፃእ ,ministers Dulles (),USA Eden ()UK እና Bidault ().France Proposals ን እቲ reunification ካብ Germany ኔሮም ምንም :ሓድሽ ኣቕድም ኣቢሉ አብ ልዕሊ 20 መጋቢት ,1952 talks ብዝዕባ ሓደ German ,reunification initiated ብ እቲ socalled 'Stalin ',መዝገብ ended ድሕሪ እቲ United ,Kingdom ,France እና እቲ United States insisted እቲ ሓደ unified Germany ይሓይሽ ዘይኮነ ኩን ግሉል እና ይሓይሽ ኩን ነፃ ናብ ተሓወስ እቲ European Defence ማሕበረሰብ እና .rearm James Dunn (),USA መን met አብ ውሽጢ Paris ምስ ,Eden Adenauer እና Robert Schuman (),France affirmed እቲ ""እቲ ግኡዝ ነገር ይሓይሽ ኩን ናብ አወግድ ምይይጥ ምስ እቲ Russians እና ናብ ተውቕ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ European Defense "".ማሕበረሰብ ከም ናብ John Gaddis ""ኣብቲ ኔሩ ንእሽተይ inclination አብ ውሽጢ Western capitals ናብ ዳህሰሳ እዚ ""ውህብቶ ካብ .USSR እስካብ historian Rolf Steininger asserts እቲ 'Adenauer's conviction እቲ “neutralization ማለት sovietization” ኔሩ እቲ ዋና ረቛሒ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ rejection ካብ እቲ soviet ,proposals Adenauer እውን feared እቲ unification ይኸዉን ኣለኒ resulted አብ ውሽጢ እቲ መወዳእታ ካብ እቲ 'CDU's dominance አብ ውሽጢ እቲ .Bundestag",እንታይ ሃገር requested joining NATO ድሕሪ እቲ Berlin ?ዋዕላ,James Dunn,Soviet,CDU,Adenauer
"The phenomenalist phase of post-Humean empiricism ended by the 1940s, for by that time it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data. If a physical object statement is to be translatable into a sense-data statement, the former must be at least deducible from the latter. But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement. Remember that the translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation. There is, however, no finite set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer. According to phenomenalism, to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer, the observer would appear to the doctor to be normal. But, of course, the doctor himself must be a normal observer. If we are to specify this doctor's normality in sensory terms, we must make reference to a second doctor who, when inspecting the sense organs of the first doctor, would himself have to have the sense data a normal observer has when inspecting the sense organs of a subject who is a normal observer. And if we are to specify in sensory terms that the second doctor is a normal observer, we must refer to a third doctor, and so on (also see the third man).",42,When did phenomenosotical empiricism end?,the 1940s,first,third,second,1,"እቲ phenomenalist ደረጃ ካብ -post-Humean empiricism ended ብ እቲ ,1940s ን ብ እቲ ግዜ እቲ ነገር ዝነበረ ምዃን ብርግፀኝነት እቲ statements ብዝዕባ ኣካላዊ ነገራት ይከኣል ዘይኮነ ኩን translated ናብ ውሽጢ statements ብዝዕባ ክዉን እና ዝከኣል ትርጉም .ሰነድ እንተ ሓደ ኣካላዊ ግኡዝ ነገር ዓንቀፅ እዩ ናብ ኩን translatable ናብ ውሽጢ ሓደ -sense-data ,ዓንቀፅ እቲ ናይ ቀደም ግድን ኩን ኣብ ዝነኣሰ deducible ካብ እቲ .ጸኒሑ ግን እቲ ነገር መጺኡ ናብ ኩን ዘልእለማዊ እቲ ኣብቲ እዩ አይኮንን finite ፅምዲ ካብ statements ብዝዕባ ክዉን እና ዝከኣል -sense-data ካብ አየናይ ንሕና ይኽእል deduce ሙሉእ ሓደ ነፀላ -physical-object .ዓንቀፅ ዘክር እቲ እቲ translating ወይ paraphrasing ዓንቀፅ ግድን ኩን couched አብ ውሽጢ ስያመታት ካብ ንቡር observers አብ ውሽጢ ንቡር ኩነታት ካብ .ትዕዝብቲ ኣብቲ ,እዩ ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ አይኮንን finite ፅምዲ ካብ statements እቲ እዮም couched አብ ውሽጢ purely sensory ስያመታት እና ይኽእል ግለፅ እቲ ዕግበት ካብ እቲ ኩነታት ካብ እቲ ህላወ ካብ ሓደ ንቡር .observer ከም ናብ ,phenomenalism ናብ በል እቲ ሓደ ንቡር observer እዩ እዋናዊ እዩ ናብ ስራሕ እቲ hypothetical ዓንቀፅ እቲ ኔሮም ሓደ ዶክቶር ናብ inspect እቲ ,observer እቲ observer ይኸውን ምርካብ ናብ እቲ ዶክቶር ናብ ኩን .ንቡር ,ግን ካብ ,ዓይነት ትምህርቲ እቲ ዶክቶር himself ግድን ኩን ሓደ ንቡር .observer እንተ ንሕና እዮም ናብ specify እዚ 'doctor's normality አብ ውሽጢ sensory ,ስያመታት ንሕና ግድን ስራሕ መጣቀሲ ናብ ሓደ ካልኣይ ዶክቶር ,መን መዓዝ inspecting እቲ ትርጉም organs ካብ እቲ መጀመርታ ,ዶክቶር ይኸውን himself ኣለኒ ናብ ኣለኒ እቲ ትርጉም ሰነድ ሓደ ንቡር observer ኣለዎ መዓዝ inspecting እቲ ትርጉም organs ካብ ሓደ ዋና መን እዩ ሓደ ንቡር .observer እና እንተ ንሕና እዮም ናብ specify አብ ውሽጢ sensory ስያመታት እቲ እቲ ካልኣይ ዶክቶር እዩ ሓደ ንቡር ,observer ንሕና ግድን ምራሕ ናብ ሓደ ሳልሳይ ,ዶክቶር እና ስለዚ አብ ልዕሊ (እውን ረአ እቲ ሳልሳይ ).ሰብኣይ",መዓዝ ግቡር phenomenosotical empiricism ?መወዳእታ,እቲ 1940s,መጀመርታ,ሳልሳይ,ካልኣይ
"In the early 1900s, James J. Hill of the Great Northern began promoting settlement in the Montana prairie to fill his trains with settlers and goods. Other railroads followed suit. In 1902, the Reclamation Act was passed, allowing irrigation projects to be built in Montana's eastern river valleys. In 1909, Congress passed the Enlarged Homestead Act that expanded the amount of free land from 160 to 320 acres (0.6 to 1.3 km2) per family and in 1912 reduced the time to ""prove up"" on a claim to three years. In 1916, the Stock-Raising Homestead Act allowed homesteads of 640 acres in areas unsuitable for irrigation.  This combination of advertising and changes in the Homestead Act drew tens of thousands of homesteaders, lured by free land, with World War I bringing particularly high wheat prices. In addition, Montana was going through a temporary period of higher-than-average precipitation. Homesteaders arriving in this period were known as ""Honyockers"", or ""scissorbills."" Though the word ""honyocker"", possibly derived from the ethnic slur ""hunyak,"" was applied in a derisive manner at homesteaders as being ""greenhorns"", ""new at his business"" or ""unprepared"", the reality was that a majority of these new settlers had previous farming experience, though there were also many who did not.",43,When was the Enlarged Homestead Act passed?,640 acres,the Great Northern,0.6 to 1.3,1909,4,"አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ብግዘ ,1900s James .J ኮረብታ ካብ እቲ ምዑዝ Northern ጀሚሩ promoting settlement አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Montana prairie ናብ ምላእ ናቱ trains ምስ settlers እና .ኣቕሑ ካልእ railroads followed .ሱፍ አብ ውሽጢ ,1902 እቲ Reclamation ፍፃመ ኔሩ ,ሓሊፉ allowing irrigation projects ናብ ኩን ተሃኒጹ አብ ውሽጢ 'Montana's eastern ሩባ .valleys አብ ውሽጢ ,1909 Congress ሓሊፉ እቲ Enlarged Homestead ፍፃመ እቲ expanded እቲ መጠን ካብ ነፃ መሬት ካብ 160 ናብ 320 acres (.0.6 ናብ .1.3 )km2 per ስድራ እና አብ ውሽጢ 1912 reduced እቲ ግዜ ናብ ""መርትዖ ""ሓፍ አብ ልዕሊ ሓደ ምልከታ ናብ ሰለስተ .ዓመታት አብ ውሽጢ ,1916 እቲ -Stock-Raising Homestead ፍፃመ ተፈቂዱሉ homesteads ካብ 640 acres አብ ውሽጢ areas unsuitable ን .irrigation እዚ ጥምረት ካብ ምፍላጥ እና changes አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Homestead ፍፃመ drew tens ካብ thousands ካብ ,homesteaders lured ብ ነፃ ,መሬት ምስ ዓለም ውግእ ኣነ bringing ብፍላይ ላዕሊ ስርናይ .prices አብ ውሽጢ ,ተወሳኺ Montana ኔሩ ከያዲ ብውሽጢ ሓደ ግዚያዊ ግዘ ካብ --higher-than-average .precipitation Homesteaders arriving አብ ውሽጢ እዚ ግዘ ኔሮም ፍሉጥ ከም """",Honyockers ወይ "".""scissorbills እኳ እቲ ቃል """",honyocker possibly derived ካብ እቲ ethnic slur "",""hunyak ኔሩ applied አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ derisive ጉዳይ ኣብ homesteaders ከም ፍጥረት """",greenhorns ""ሓድሽ ኣብ ናቱ ""ስራሕቲ ንግዲ ወይ """",unprepared እቲ ክውንነት ኔሩ እቲ ሓደ መብዛሕትኡ ካብ እዚ ሓድሽ settlers ዝነበረ ዝሓለፈ farming ,ተሞክሮ እኳ ኣብቲ ኔሮም እውን ቡዙሕ መን ግቡር .ዘይኮነ",መዓዝ ኔሩ እቲ Enlarged Homestead ፍፃመ ?ሓሊፉ,640 acres,እቲ ምዑዝ Northern,.0.6 ናብ .1.3,1909
"The book was never published. Instead the Normans whirled off to New York. Norman published the gist of his planned travel book curiously mixed with vituperation against the Ottoman Empire in an article in June, 1896, in Scribner's Magazine. The empire had descended from an enlightened civilization ruling over barbarians for their own good to something considerably less. The difference was the Hamidian Massacres, which were being conducted even as the couple traveled the Balkans. According to Norman now, the empire had been established by ""the Moslem horde"" from Asia, which was stopped by ""intrepid Hungary."" Furthermore, ""Greece shook off the turbaned destroyer of her people"" and so on. The Russians were suddenly liberators of oppressed Balkan states. Having portrayed the Armenians as revolutionaries in the name of freedom with the expectation of being rescued by the intervention of Christian Europe, he states ""but her hope was vain."" England had ""turned her back."" Norman concluded his exhortation with ""In the Balkans one learns to hate the Turk."" Norman made sure that Gladstone read the article.

"In July 1943, as a result of the American Federation of Musicians boycott of US recording studios, the a cappella vocal group The Song Spinners had a best-seller with ""Comin' In On A Wing And A Prayer"". In the 1950s several recording groups, notably The Hi-Los and the Four Freshmen, introduced complex jazz harmonies to a cappella performances. The King's Singers are credited with promoting interest in small-group a cappella performances in the 1960s. In 1983 an a cappella group known as The Flying Pickets had a Christmas 'number one' in the UK with a cover of Yazoo's (known in the US as Yaz) ""Only You"". A cappella music attained renewed prominence from the late 1980s onward, spurred by the success of Top 40 recordings by artists such as The Manhattan Transfer, Bobby McFerrin, Huey Lewis and the News, All-4-One, The Nylons, Backstreet Boys and Boyz II Men.[citation needed]",48,When did The Song Spinners sell their best seller?,July 1943,The Song Spinners,Bobby McFerrin,the Four Freshmen,1,"አብ ውሽጢ ሓምለ ,1943 ከም ሓደ ውፅኢት ካብ እቲ American Federation ካብ Musicians boycott ካብ ንሕና recording ,studios እቲ ሓደ cappella vocal ጉጅለ እቲ ደርፊ Spinners ዝነበረ ሓደ -best-seller ምስ ""'Comin አብ ውሽጢ አብ ልዕሊ ሓደ Wing እና ሓደ "".Prayer አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 1950s ቡዙሓት recording ,groups notably እቲ -Hi-Los እና እቲ ዓርባዕተ ,Freshmen introduced ሕውስዋስ jazz harmonies ናብ ሓደ cappella .performances እቲ 'King's Singers እዮም credited ምስ promoting ወለድ አብ ውሽጢ -small-group ሓደ cappella performances አብ ውሽጢ እቲ .1960s አብ ውሽጢ 1983 ሓደ ሓደ cappella ጉጅለ ፍሉጥ ከም እቲ Flying Pickets ዝነበረ ሓደ Christmas 'ቑጽሪ 'ሓደ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ UK ምስ ሓደ ሽፋን ካብ 'Yazoo's (ፍሉጥ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ንሕና ከም )Yaz ""ጥራሕ "".ንስኻ ሓደ cappella ሙዚቃ attained renewed prominence ካብ እቲ ረፋድ 1980s ,onward spurred ብ እቲ ዓወት ካብ ላዕለዋይ 40 recordings ብ artists ከምዚ ከም እቲ Manhattan ,ምምሕልላፍ Bobby ,McFerrin Huey Lewis እና እቲ ,ዜና --,All-4-One እቲ ,Nylons Backstreet Boys እና Boyz II .[Men.[citation ]needed",መዓዝ ግቡር እቲ ደርፊ Spinners ሽጥ ናቶም ምሩፅ ?seller,ሓምለ 1943,እቲ ደርፊ Spinners,Bobby McFerrin,እቲ ዓርባዕተ Freshmen

"Charles ""Wag"" Bennett, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate, London, England. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language. Also in 1966, Schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol Reg Park, who became his friend and mentor. The training paid off and, in 1967, Schwarzenegger won the title for the first time, becoming the youngest ever Mr. Universe at the age of 20. He would go on to win the title a further three times. Schwarzenegger then flew back to Munich, training for four to six hours daily, attending business school and working in a health club (Rolf Putziger's gym where he worked and trained from 1966–1968), returning in 1968 to London to win his next Mr. Universe title.

"The Gram stain, developed in 1884 by Hans Christian Gram, characterises bacteria based on the structural characteristics of their cell walls. The thick layers of peptidoglycan in the ""Gram-positive"" cell wall stain purple, while the thin ""Gram-negative"" cell wall appears pink. By combining morphology and Gram-staining, most bacteria can be classified as belonging to one of four groups (Gram-positive cocci, Gram-positive bacilli, Gram-negative cocci and Gram-negative bacilli). Some organisms are best identified by stains other than the Gram stain, particularly mycobacteria or Nocardia, which show acid-fastness on Ziehl–Neelsen or similar stains.

"Erik Erikson (1902-1994) became one of the earliest psychologists to take an explicit interest in identity. The Eriksonian framework rests upon a distinction among the psychological sense of continuity, known as the ego identity (sometimes identified simply as ""the self""); the personal idiosyncrasies that separate one person from the next, known as the personal identity; and the collection of social roles that a person might play, known as either the social identity or the cultural identity. Erikson's work, in the psychodynamic tradition, aimed to investigate the process of identity formation across a lifespan. Progressive strength in the ego identity, for example, can be charted in terms of a series of stages in which identity is formed in response to increasingly sophisticated challenges. The process of forming a viable sense of identity for the culture is conceptualized as an adolescent task, and those who do not manage a resynthesis of childhood identifications are seen as being in a state of 'identity diffusion' whereas those who retain their initially given identities unquestioned have 'foreclosed' identities (Weinreich & Saunderson 2003 p7-8). On some readings of Erikson, the development of a strong ego identity, along with the proper integration into a stable society and culture, lead to a stronger sense of identity in general. Accordingly, a deficiency in either of these factors may increase the chance of an identity crisis or confusion (Cote & Levine 2002, p. 22).",60,When did Erik Erikson start observing identity?,22,one,1902-1994,8),3,"Erik Erikson (-)1902-1994 ኮይኑ ሓደ ካብ እቲ earliest psychologists ናብ ውሰድ ሓደ explicit ወለድ አብ ውሽጢ .መንነት እቲ Eriksonian ምስሊ rests ኣብ ግዘ ሓደ distinction ካብዞም እቲ psychological ትርጉም ካብ ,continuity ፍሉጥ ከም እቲ ስሰዐ መንነት (ሓደ ሓደ ግዘ identified simply ከም ""እቲ "");ዓርሰ እቲ ውልቃዊ idiosyncrasies እቲ ፍለ ሓደ ሰብ ካብ እቲ ,ቀፃሊ ፍሉጥ ከም እቲ ውልቃዊ ;መንነት እና እቲ ጥርኑፍ ካብ ማሕበራዊ roles እቲ ሓደ ሰብ ይኸዉን ,ተፃወት ፍሉጥ ከም ወይ እቲ ማሕበራዊ መንነት ወይ እቲ cultural .መንነት 'Erikson's ,ስራሕ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ psychodynamic ,ልምዲ aimed ናብ መርምር እቲ ከይዲ ካብ መንነት formation ሰገር ሓደ .lifespan Progressive ጥንካረ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ስሰዐ ,መንነት ን ,ኣብነት ይኽእል ኩን charted አብ ውሽጢ ስያመታት ካብ ሓደ ተኸታታሊ ካብ stages አብ ውሽጢ አየናይ መንነት እዩ formed አብ ውሽጢ ምላሽ ናብ increasingly ዝተወሳሰበ .challenges እቲ ከይዲ ካብ forming ሓደ viable ትርጉም ካብ መንነት ን እቲ ባህሊ እዩ conceptualized ከም ሓደ adolescent ,ዕዮ እና እቲኦም መን ግበር ዘይኮነ ኣተሓሕዛ ሓደ resynthesis ካብ ቁልዕነት identifications እዮም ተራእዩ ከም ፍጥረት አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ግዝኣት ካብ 'መንነት 'diffusion ክኸውን ከሎ እቲኦም መን ዓቀበ ናቶም initially ዝተወሃበ identities unquestioned ኣለኒ ''foreclosed identities (Weinreich & Saunderson 2003 -).p7-8 አብ ልዕሊ ንእሽተይ readings ካብ ,Erikson እቲ ዕብየት ካብ ሓደ ጠንካራ ስሰዐ ,መንነት ማዕረ ኣንፈት ምስ እቲ ቅቡል integration ናብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ዝተረጋገአ ሕብረተሰብ እና ,ባህሊ ምራሕ ናብ ሓደ stronger ትርጉም ካብ መንነት አብ ውሽጢ .ሓፈሻዊ ,Accordingly ሓደ deficiency አብ ውሽጢ ወይ ካብ እዚ factors ተዝኸዉን ወስኽ እቲ ዕድል ካብ ሓደ መንነት ቅልውላው ወይ ምድንጋራት (Cote & Levine ,2002 .p ).22",መዓዝ ግቡር Erik Erikson ጀምር observing ?መንነት,22,ሓደ,-1902-1994,)8
"The degree to which adolescents are perceived as autonomous beings varies widely by culture, as do the behaviors that represent this emerging autonomy. Psychologists have identified three main types of autonomy: emotional independence, behavioral autonomy, and cognitive autonomy. Emotional autonomy is defined in terms of an adolescent's relationships with others, and often includes the development of more mature emotional connections with adults and peers. Behavioral autonomy encompasses an adolescent's developing ability to regulate his or her own behavior, to act on personal decisions, and to self-govern. Cultural differences are especially visible in this category because it concerns issues of dating, social time with peers, and time-management decisions. Cognitive autonomy describes the capacity for an adolescent to partake in processes of independent reasoning and decision-making without excessive reliance on social validation. Converging influences from adolescent cognitive development, expanding social relationships, an increasingly adultlike appearance, and the acceptance of more rights and responsibilities enhance feelings of autonomy for adolescents. Proper development of autonomy has been tied to good mental health, high self-esteem, self-motivated tendencies, positive self-concepts, and self-initiating and regulating behaviors. Furthermore, it has been found that adolescents' mental health is best when their feelings about autonomy match closely with those of their parents.",61,How many types of autonomy are there?,—,three,—,—,2,"እቲ መዐቀኒ ናብ አየናይ adolescents እዮም perceived ከም autonomous beings varies widely ብ ,ባህሊ ከም ግበር እቲ behaviors እቲ ውክልና እዚ emerging .autonomy Psychologists ኣለኒ identified ሰለስተ ዋና types ካብ :autonomy ስምዒታዊ ,independence behavioral ,autonomy እና ምስትውዓል .autonomy ስምዒታዊ autonomy እዩ defined አብ ውሽጢ ስያመታት ካብ ሓደ 'adolescent's relationships ምስ ,others እና ኩል ግዘ includes እቲ ዕብየት ካብ ቡዙሕ mature ስምዒታዊ connections ምስ adults እና .መዛኑ Behavioral autonomy encompasses ሓደ 'adolescent's developing ተኽእሎ ናብ regulate ናቱ ወይ ንሳ ወንን ,ፀባይ ናብ ፍፃመ አብ ልዕሊ ውልቃዊ ,decisions እና ናብ -.self-govern Cultural differences እዮም ብፍላይ visible አብ ውሽጢ እዚ ምደባ ምኽንያቱ እቲ ነገር concerns ፀገማት ካብ ,dating ማሕበራዊ ግዜ ምስ ,መዛኑ እና -time-management .decisions ምስትውዓል autonomy describes እቲ ትኽእሎ ን ሓደ adolescent ናብ partake አብ ውሽጢ processes ካብ ዓርሱ ዝኸኣለ reasoning እና -decision-making ብዘይካ መጠኑ ዝሓለፈ reliance አብ ልዕሊ ማሕበራዊ .validation Converging influences ካብ adolescent ምስትውዓል ,ዕብየት expanding ማሕበራዊ ,relationships ሓደ increasingly adultlike ,ቁመና እና እቲ acceptance ካብ ቡዙሕ rights እና responsibilities ኣግዝፍ feelings ካብ autonomy ን .adolescents ቅቡል ዕብየት ካብ autonomy ኣለዎ ዝነበረ tied ናብ ፅቡቅ ስነ ኣእምሮኣዊ ,ጥዕና ላዕሊ -,self-esteem -self-motivated ,tendencies ኣወንታዊ -,self-concepts እና -self-initiating እና regulating .behaviors ,ካብዚ ተወሳኺ እቲ ነገር ኣለዎ ዝነበረ ተረኺቡ እቲ 'adolescents ስነ ኣእምሮኣዊ ጥዕና እዩ ምሩፅ መዓዝ ናቶም feelings ብዝዕባ autonomy ግጥም closely ምስ እቲኦም ካብ ናቶም .ኣቦን ኣዶን",ከመይ ቡዙሕ types ካብ autonomy እዮም ?ኣብቲ,—,ሰለስተ,—,—

This can be understood in the sense that literature unites a large community by provoking universal emotions.

Authors choose literary device according to what psychological emotion he or she is attempting to describe, thus certain literary devices are more emotionally effective than others.",68,"Who explains that the temporal and emotional amount which a person devotes to understanding a character's situation allows literature to be considered ""ecologically valid in the study of emotion""?",—,—,Hogan,—,3,"Hogan እውን explains እቲ እቲ temporal እና ስምዒታዊ መጠን አየናይ ሓደ ሰብ devotes ናብ understanding ሓደ character’s ኩነታት አብ ውሽጢ ስነ ጽሑፍ allows ስነ ጽሑፍ ናብ ኩን ገምገመ []“ecological[ly ዘገልግል አብ ውሽጢ እቲ መፅናዕቲ ካብ .emotion” እዚ ይኽእል ኩን ርዱእ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ትርጉም እቲ ስነ ጽሑፍ unites ሓደ ገዚፍ ማሕበረሰብ ብ provoking universal .emotions እቲ ነገር እውን allows readers ናብ ናይ ምርካብ ዓቅሚ cultural aspects እቲ ንሶም እዮም ዘይኮነ ዝተቓለዐ ናብ ስለዝኾነ provoking ሓድሽ ስምዒታዊ .experiences Authors ምረፅ literary መሳርሒ ከም ናብ እንታይ psychological emotion ንሱ ወይ እሳ እዩ attempting ናብ ,ግለፅ ስለዝኾነ ውሱን literary devices እዮም ቡዙሕ emotionally ውፅኢታዊ ካብ .others","መን explains እቲ እቲ temporal እና ስምዒታዊ መጠን አየናይ ሓደ ሰብ devotes ናብ understanding ሓደ 'character's ኩነታት allows ስነ ጽሑፍ ናብ ኩን ገምገመ ""ecologically ዘገልግል አብ ውሽጢ እቲ መፅናዕቲ ካብ ""?emotion",—,—,Hogan,—

"For any animal, survival requires maintaining a variety of parameters of bodily state within a limited range of variation: these include temperature, water content, salt concentration in the bloodstream, blood glucose levels, blood oxygen level, and others. The ability of an animal to regulate the internal environment of its body—the milieu intérieur, as pioneering physiologist Claude Bernard called it—is known as homeostasis (Greek for ""standing still""). Maintaining homeostasis is a crucial function of the brain. The basic principle that underlies homeostasis is negative feedback: any time a parameter diverges from its set-point, sensors generate an error signal that evokes a response that causes the parameter to shift back toward its optimum value.

In the 1950s several recording groups, notably The Hi-Los and the Four Freshmen, introduced complex jazz harmonies to a cappella performances. The King's Singers are credited with promoting interest in small-group a cappella performances in the 1960s. In 1983 an a cappella group known as The Flying Pickets had a Christmas 'number one' in the UK with a cover of Yazoo's (known in the US as Yaz) ""Only You"".

"In 2007, two FAA whistleblowers, inspectors Charalambe ""Bobby"" Boutris and Douglas E. Peters, alleged that Boutris said he attempted to ground Southwest after finding cracks in the fuselage, but was prevented by supervisors he said were friendly with the airline. This was validated by a report by the Department of Transportation which found FAA managers had allowed Southwest Airlines to fly 46 airplanes in 2006 and 2007 that were overdue for safety inspections, ignoring concerns raised by inspectors. Audits of other airlines resulted in two airlines grounding hundreds of planes, causing thousands of flight cancellations. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held hearings in April 2008. Jim Oberstar, former chairman of the committee said its investigation uncovered a pattern of regulatory abuse and widespread regulatory lapses, allowing 117 aircraft to be operated commercially although not in compliance with FAA safety rules. Oberstar said there was a ""culture of coziness"" between senior FAA officials and the airlines and ""a systematic breakdown"" in the FAA's culture that resulted in ""malfeasance, bordering on corruption."" In 2008 the FAA proposed to fine Southwest $10.2 million for failing to inspect older planes for cracks, and in 2009 Southwest and the FAA agreed that Southwest would pay a $7.5 million penalty and would adopt new safety procedures, with the fine doubling if Southwest failed to follow through.",81,Who made allegations against Southwest in 2007?,April 2008,FAA,Boutris,the Department of Transportation,3,"አብ ውሽጢ ,2007 ክልተ FAA ,whistleblowers inspectors Charalambe """"Bobby Boutris እና Douglas .E ,Peters alleged እቲ Boutris ኢሉ ንሱ attempted ናብ ምድሪ Southwest ድሕሪ finding cracks አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ,fuselage ግን ኔሩ prevented ብ supervisors ንሱ ኢሉ ኔሮም ምቕሉል ምስ እቲ .airline እዚ ኔሩ validated ብ ሓደ ኣፍልጥ ብ እቲ ክፍሊ ካብ መጓዓዝያ አየናይ ተረኺቡ FAA managers ዝነበረ ተፈቂዱሉ Southwest Airlines ናብ ንፈር 46 airplanes አብ ውሽጢ 2006 እና 2007 እቲ ኔሮም overdue ን ድሕንነት ,inspections ignoring concerns ተሰአ ብ .inspectors Audits ካብ ካልእ airlines resulted አብ ውሽጢ ክልተ airlines grounding hundreds ካብ ,planes causing thousands ካብ በረራ .cancellations እቲ ገዛ መጓዓዝያ እና Infrastructure Committee ተገይሩ hearings አብ ውሽጢ ጉንበት .2008 Jim ,Oberstar ናይ ቀደም chairman ካብ እቲ committee ኢሉ ናቱ investigation uncovered ሓደ ንድፊ ካብ regulatory ፀረፈ እና widespread regulatory ,lapses allowing 117 aircraft ናብ ኩን operated commercially ዋላ እኳ ዘይኮነ አብ ውሽጢ ምእዙዝነት ምስ FAA ድሕንነት .ስርዓታት Oberstar ኢሉ ኣብቲ ኔሩ ሓደ ""ባህሊ ካብ ""coziness አብ መንጎ ላዕለዋይ FAA officials እና እቲ airlines እና ""ሓደ systematic ""breakdown አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 'FAA's ባህሊ እቲ resulted አብ ውሽጢ "",malfeasance bordering አብ ልዕሊ .""corruption አብ ውሽጢ 2008 እቲ FAA proposed ናብ ደሓን Southwest $.10.2 ሚልዮን ን failing ናብ inspect older planes ን ,cracks እና አብ ውሽጢ 2009 Southwest እና እቲ FAA agreed እቲ Southwest ይኸውን ክፈል ሓደ $.7.5 ሚልዮን penalty እና ይኸውን ተቐባልነት ሓድሽ ድሕንነት ,procedures ምስ እቲ ደሓን doubling እንተ Southwest ወዲቑ ናብ ተኸተል .ብውሽጢ",መን ዝተሰርሐ allegations ተቃራኒ Southwest አብ ውሽጢ ?2007,ጉንበት 2008,FAA,Boutris,እቲ ክፍሊ ካብ መጓዓዝያ

"In recent years, the city has experienced steady population growth, and has been faced with the issue of accommodating more residents. In 2006, after growing by 4,000 citizens per year for the previous 16 years, regional planners expected the population of Seattle to grow by 200,000 people by 2040. However, former mayor Greg Nickels supported plans that would increase the population by 60%, or 350,000 people, by 2040 and worked on ways to accommodate this growth while keeping Seattle's single-family housing zoning laws.

"Home-based manufacturing operations were active year round. Families willingly deployed their children in these income generating home enterprises. In many cases, men worked from home. In France, over 58 percent of garment workers operated out of their homes; in Germany, the number of full-time home operations nearly doubled between 1882 and 1907; and in the United States, millions of families operated out of home seven days a week, year round to produce garments, shoes, artificial flowers, feathers, match boxes, toys, umbrellas and other products. Children aged 5–14 worked alongside the parents. Home-based operations and child labour in Australia, Britain, Austria and other parts of the world was common. Rural areas similarly saw families deploying their children in agriculture.

"In 1816, François Magendie discovered that dogs fed only carbohydrates (sugar), fat (olive oil), and water died evidently of starvation, but dogs also fed protein survived, identifying protein as an essential dietary component. William Prout in 1827 was the first person to divide foods into carbohydrates, fat, and protein. During the 19th century, Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Justus von Liebig quarrelled over their shared belief that animals get their protein directly from plants (animal and plant protein are the same and that humans do not create organic compounds). With a reputation as the leading organic chemist of his day but with no credentials in animal physiology, Liebig grew rich making food extracts like beef bouillon and infant formula that were later found to be of questionable nutritious value. In the 1860s, Claude Bernard discovered that body fat can be synthesized from carbohydrate and protein, showing that the energy in blood glucose can be stored as fat or as glycogen.",92,What year did François Magendie discover that dogs died of starvation?,1816,Liebig,Claude Bernard,first,1,"አብ ውሽጢ ,1816 François Magendie discovered እቲ dogs fed ጥራሕ carbohydrates (),ሽኮር ረጒድ (olive ),ዘይቲ እና ማይ ሞይቱ evidently ካብ ,starvation ግን dogs እውን fed protein ,survived identifying protein ከም ሓደ ኣገዳሲ dietary .component William Prout አብ ውሽጢ 1827 ኔሩ እቲ መጀመርታ ሰብ ናብ ምምቃል foods ናብ ውሽጢ ,carbohydrates ,ረጒድ እና .protein አብ እዋን እቲ 19th ,ዘመን -Jean-Baptiste Dumas እና Justus von Liebig quarrelled ልዕሊ ናቶም shared እምነት እቲ animals ምርካብ ናቶም protein directly ካብ ተኽልታት (እንስሳ እና ተኽሊ protein እዮም እቲ ማዕረ እና እቲ humans ግበር ዘይኮነ ፍጠር organic ).compounds ምስ ሓደ ክብሪ ከም እቲ leading organic chemist ካብ ናቱ መዓልቲ ግን ምስ አይኮንን credentials አብ ውሽጢ እንስሳ ,physiology Liebig grew ሓፍታም making ምግቢ extracts ምፍታው ስጋ ብዕራይ bouillon እና ህፃን formula እቲ ኔሮም ዳሕራይ ተረኺቡ ናብ ኩን ካብ questionable nutritious .ዋጋ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ,1860s Claude Bernard discovered እቲ ሰውነት ረጒድ ይኽእል ኩን synthesized ካብ carbohydrate እና ,protein showing እቲ እቲ ጉልበት አብ ውሽጢ ደም glucose ይኽእል ኩን stored ከም ረጒድ ወይ ከም .glycogen",እንታይ ዓመት ግቡር François Magendie ረኸበ እቲ dogs ሞይቱ ካብ ?starvation,1816,Liebig,Claude Bernard,መጀመርታ

"Besides the schism, the western church was riven by theological controversies, some of which turned into heresies. John Wycliffe (d. 1384), an English theologian, was condemned as a heretic in 1415 for teaching that the laity should have access to the text of the Bible as well as for holding views on the Eucharist that were contrary to church doctrine. Wycliffe's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages: Lollardy in England and Hussitism in Bohemia. The Bohemian movement initiated with the teaching of Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in 1415 after being condemned as a heretic by the Council of Constance. The Hussite church, although the target of a crusade, survived beyond the Middle Ages. Other heresies were manufactured, such as the accusations against the Knights Templar that resulted in their suppression in 1312 and the division of their great wealth between the French King Philip IV (r. 1285–1314) and the Hospitallers.",95,In what year was John Wycliffe condemned for teaching that the laity should have access to the text of the Bible?,two,Eucharist,Hospitallers,1415,4,"ጎና ጎኒ እቲ ,schism እቲ western ቤተ ክርስትያን ኔሩ riven ብ theological ,controversies ንእሽተይ ካብ አየናይ turned ናብ ውሽጢ .heresies John Wycliffe (.d ),1384 ሓደ ኢንግሊሽ ,theologian ኔሩ condemned ከም ሓደ heretic አብ ውሽጢ 1415 ን teaching እቲ እቲ laity ይሓይሽ ኣለኒ ናይ ምርካብ ዓቅሚ ናብ እቲ ጽሑፍ ካብ እቲ Bible ከም ደሓን ከም ን holding views አብ ልዕሊ እቲ Eucharist እቲ ኔሮም contrary ናብ ቤተ ክርስትያን .doctrine 'Wycliffe's teachings influenced ክልተ ካብ እቲ ዋና heretical movements ካብ እቲ ዳሕራይ ማእኸል :Ages Lollardy አብ ውሽጢ England እና Hussitism አብ ውሽጢ .Bohemia እቲ Bohemian ምንቅስቓስ initiated ምስ እቲ teaching ካብ Jan ,Hus መን ኔሩ burned ኣብ እቲ ጉንዲ አብ ውሽጢ 1415 ድሕሪ ፍጥረት condemned ከም ሓደ heretic ብ እቲ ዋዕላ ካብ .Constance እቲ Hussite ,ቤተ ክርስትያን ዋላ እኳ እቲ ዒላማ ካብ ሓደ ,crusade survived ብልዕሊ እቲ ማእኸል .Ages ካልእ heresies ኔሮም ,manufactured ከምዚ ከም እቲ accusations ተቃራኒ እቲ Knights Templar እቲ resulted አብ ውሽጢ ናቶም suppression አብ ውሽጢ 1312 እና እቲ division ካብ ናቶም ምዑዝ ሃፍቲ አብ መንጎ እቲ French ንጉስ Philip IV (.r )1285–1314 እና እቲ .Hospitallers",አብ ውሽጢ እንታይ ዓመት ኔሩ John Wycliffe condemned ን teaching እቲ እቲ laity ይሓይሽ ኣለኒ ናይ ምርካብ ዓቅሚ ናብ እቲ ጽሑፍ ካብ እቲ ?Bible,ክልተ,Eucharist,Hospitallers,1415
"A samurai could take concubines but their backgrounds were checked by higher-ranked samurai. In many cases, taking a concubine was akin to a marriage. Kidnapping a concubine, although common in fiction, would have been shameful, if not criminal. If the concubine was a commoner, a messenger was sent with betrothal money or a note for exemption of tax to ask for her parents' acceptance. Even though the woman would not be a legal wife, a situation normally considered a demotion, many wealthy merchants believed that being the concubine of a samurai was superior to being the legal wife of a commoner. When a merchant's daughter married a samurai, her family's money erased the samurai's debts, and the samurai's social status improved the standing of the merchant family.

Annick Cojean, a journalist for Le Monde, wrote in her book, Gaddafi's Harem that Gaddafi had raped, tortured, performed urolagnia, and imprisoned hundreds or thousands of women, usually very young. Another source—Libyan psychologist Seham Sergewa—reported that several of his female bodyguards claim to have been raped by Gaddafi and senior officials.

"Peruvian Carnival incorporates elements of violence and reflects the urban violence in Peruvian society following the internal conflict in Peru. Traditionally, Peruvian Andean festivities were held on this period every year because it is the rainy season. It was already violent during the 19th century, but the government limited the practice. During the early 20th century it consisted partying and parading, while in the second half of the 20th century it acquired violent characteristics that continued. It was banned, first from the streets in 1958 and altogether in 1959 by the Prado government. It consisted basically of water battles in a traditional way,[clarification needed] while in later years it included playing with dirty water, mud, oil and colorants -and also including fighting and sometimes looting private property and sexual assaults on women. It has become an excuse for criminal gangs to rob people while pretending to celebrate. As of 2010, it had become so violent that the government imposed penalties of up to eight years in prison for violence during the games (the games themselves are not forbidden, but using violence during the games or coercing others to participate is).",105,Which type of carnival incorporates elements of violence?,Peruvian Carnival,up to eight years,later years,2010,1,"Peruvian Carnival incorporates elements ካብ ዓመጽ እና reflects እቲ ከተማ ዓመጽ አብ ውሽጢ Peruvian ሕብረተሰብ ምኽታል እቲ ውሽጣዊ ባእሲ አብ ውሽጢ .Peru ,Traditionally Peruvian Andean festivities ኔሮም ተገይሩ አብ ልዕሊ እዚ ግዘ ኩሉ ዓመት ምኽንያቱ እቲ ነገር እዩ እቲ rainy .ወቕቲ እቲ ነገር ኔሩ ክውን ዓመጸና አብ እዋን እቲ 19th ,ዘመን ግን እቲ መንግስቲ limited እቲ .ትግበራ አብ እዋን እቲ ብግዘ 20th ዘመን እቲ ነገር consisted partying እና ,parading እስካብ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ካልኣይ ፍርቂ ካብ እቲ 20th ዘመን እቲ ነገር ዝተዓደገ ዓመጸና ባህርያት እቲ .continued እቲ ነገር ኔሩ ,banned መጀመርታ ካብ እቲ streets አብ ውሽጢ 1958 እና altogether አብ ውሽጢ 1959 ብ እቲ Prado .መንግስቲ እቲ ነገር consisted ብመሰረቱ ካብ ማይ battles አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ባህላዊ ,[way,[clarification ]needed እስካብ አብ ውሽጢ ዳሕራይ ዓመታት እቲ ነገር included ምፅዋት ምስ ረሳሕ ,ማይ ,ጭቃ ዘይቲ እና colorants -እና እውን ይሓውስ ባእሲ እና ሓደ ሓደ ግዘ looting ብሕታዊ ንብረት እና sexual assaults አብ ልዕሊ .ኣንስቲ እቲ ነገር ኣለዎ ምዃን ሓደ ምኽኒት ን criminal gangs ናብ rob ህዝቢ እስካብ pretending ናብ .ምኽባር ከም ካብ ,2010 እቲ ነገር ዝነበረ ምዃን ስለዚ ዓመጸና እቲ እቲ መንግስቲ imposed penalties ካብ ሓፍ ናብ ሸሞንተ ዓመታት አብ ውሽጢ እስር ቤት ን ዓመጽ አብ እዋን እቲ games (እቲ games ባዕሎም እዮም ዘይኮነ ,ክልኩል ግን using ዓመጽ አብ እዋን እቲ games ወይ coercing others ናብ ምስታፍ ).እዩ",አየናይ ዓይነት ካብ carnival incorporates elements ካብ ?ዓመጽ,Peruvian Carnival,ሓፍ ናብ ሸሞንተ ዓመታት,ዳሕራይ ዓመታት,2010
"Holometabolism, or complete metamorphosis, is where the insect changes in four stages, an egg or embryo, a larva, a pupa and the adult or imago. In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form can be one of several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin.:151 Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults. Butterflies are a well-known example of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, although most insects use this life cycle.

Schiotz stated during the 450th anniversary of the Reformation, that earlier commemorations were viewed almost as a triumph.

"On the eastern front, progress was very slow. The Russian army was heavily dependent upon its main magazines in Poland, and the Prussian army launched several successful raids against them. One of them, led by general Platen in September resulted in the loss of 2,000 Russians, mostly captured, and the destruction of 5,000 wagons. Deprived of men, the Prussians had to resort to this new sort of warfare, raiding, to delay the advance of their enemies. Nonetheless, at the end of the year, they suffered two critical setbacks. The Russians under Zakhar Chernyshev and Pyotr Rumyantsev stormed Kolberg in Pomerania, while the Austrians captured Schweidnitz. The loss of Kolberg cost Prussia its last port on the Baltic Sea.

"In Whitehead's view, then, concepts such as ""quality"", ""matter"", and ""form"" are problematic. These ""classical"" concepts fail to adequately account for change, and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world. They are useful abstractions, but are not the world's basic building blocks. What is ordinarily conceived of as a single person, for instance, is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events. After all, people change all the time, if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience. These occasions of experience are logically distinct, but are progressively connected in what Whitehead calls a ""society"" of events. By assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe, materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete (what Whitehead calls the ""fallacy of misplaced concreteness"").",118,Who called quality and form problematic?,—,—,second,Whitehead,4,"አብ ውሽጢ 'Whitehead's ,ኣረኣእያ ,ሽዑ concepts ከምዚ ከም """",ፅፈት """",ነገር እና """"ፎርም እዮም .problematic እዚ """"classical concepts ምውዳቕ ናብ adequately ኣካውንት ን ,ለውጢ እና overlook እቲ ንቑሕ እና experiential ተፈጥሮ ካብ እቲ ብጥዕሚ መሰረታዊ elements ካብ እቲ .ዓለም ንሶም እዮም ጠቃሚ ,abstractions ግን እዮም ዘይኮነ እቲ 'world's መሰረታዊ ምህናፅ .blocks እንታይ እዩ ordinarily conceived ካብ ከም ሓደ ነፀላ ,ሰብ ን ,ኣብነት እዩ philosophically described ከም ሓደ continuum ካብ overlapping .events ድሕሪ ,ኩሎም ህዝቢ ለውጢ ኩሎም እቲ ,ግዜ እንተ ጥራሕ ምኽንያቱ ንሶም ኣለኒ aged ብ ካልእ ካልኣይ እና ዝነበረ ንእሽተይ ርሑቅ .ተሞክሮ እዚ occasions ካብ ተሞክሮ እዮም logically ,ዝጠፈአ ግን እዮም progressively connected አብ ውሽጢ እንታይ Whitehead calls ሓደ """"ሕብረተሰብ ካብ .events ብ assuming እቲ enduring objects እዮም እቲ ብጥዕሚ ሓቂ እና መሰረታዊ ነገራት አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ,universe materialists ኣለኒ mistaken እቲ መመላኽዒ ን እቲ ጽኑዕ (እንታይ Whitehead calls እቲ ""fallacy ካብ misplaced "").concreteness",መን ዝተፀወዐ ፅፈት እና ፎርም ?problematic,—,—,ካልኣይ,Whitehead

During boiling, water in the wort evaporates, but the sugars and other components of the wort remain; this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer. Boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes left over from the mashing stage. Hops are added during boiling as a source of bitterness, flavour and aroma.

"About 1150 species of fungi have been recorded from Antarctica, of which about 750 are non-lichen-forming and 400 are lichen-forming. Some of these species are cryptoendoliths as a result of evolution under extreme conditions, and have significantly contributed to shaping the impressive rock formations of the McMurdo Dry Valleys and surrounding mountain ridges. The apparently simple morphology, scarcely differentiated structures, metabolic systems and enzymes still active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles shown by such fungi make them particularly suited to harsh environments such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. In particular, their thick-walled and strongly melanized cells make them resistant to UV light. Those features can also be observed in algae and cyanobacteria, suggesting that these are adaptations to the conditions prevailing in Antarctica. This has led to speculation that, if life ever occurred on Mars, it might have looked similar to Antarctic fungi such as Cryomyces minteri. Some of these fungi are also apparently endemic to Antarctica. Endemic Antarctic fungi also include certain dung-inhabiting species which have had to evolve in response to the double challenge of extreme cold while growing on dung, and the need to survive passage through the gut of warm-blooded animals.",133,How many species of fungi have been recorded from Antarctica?,cyanobacteria,algae,About 1150,the McMurdo Dry Valleys,3,"ብዝዕባ 1150 ዓሌታት ካብ fungi ኣለኒ ዝነበረ recorded ካብ ,Antarctica ካብ አየናይ ብዝዕባ 750 እዮም --non-lichen-forming እና 400 እዮም -.lichen-forming ንእሽተይ ካብ እዚ ዓሌታት እዮም cryptoendoliths ከም ሓደ ውፅኢት ካብ ደፋእታዊ ለውጢ ትሕቲ ጫፍ ,ኩነታት እና ኣለኒ significantly contributed ናብ shaping እቲ ዘደምም ከውሒ formations ካብ እቲ McMurdo ደረቅ Valleys እና ከባቢ ጎቦ .ridges እቲ እስካብ ዝፈልጦ ቀሊል ,morphology scarcely differentiated ,structures metabolic systems እና enzymes እስካብ ሕዚ ንቑሕ ኣብ ብጣዕሚ ውሑድ ,temperatures እና reduced ህይወት cycles shown ብ ከምዚ fungi ስራሕ ንሶም ብፍላይ suited ናብ ዘይምቹ environments ከምዚ ከም እቲ McMurdo ደረቅ .Valleys አብ ውሽጢ ,ብፍሉይ ናቶም -thick-walled እና strongly melanized cells ስራሕ ንሶም resistant ናብ UV .ብርሃን እቲኦም መለለይታት ይኽእል እውን ኩን observed አብ ውሽጢ algae እና ,cyanobacteria suggesting እቲ እዚ እዮም adaptations ናብ እቲ ኩነታት prevailing አብ ውሽጢ .Antarctica እዚ ኣለዎ መረሐ ናብ speculation ,እቲ እንተ ህይወት ብስሩ ዝተፈጠረ አብ ልዕሊ ,Mars እቲ ነገር ይኸዉን ኣለኒ looked ተመሳሳሊ ናብ Antarctic fungi ከምዚ ከም Cryomyces .minteri ንእሽተይ ካብ እዚ fungi እዮም እውን እስካብ ዝፈልጦ endemic ናብ .Antarctica Endemic Antarctic fungi እውን ይሓውስ ውሱን -dung-inhabiting ዓሌታት አየናይ ኣለኒ ዝነበረ ናብ መፂኡ አብ ውሽጢ ምላሽ ናብ እቲ ዕፅፊ ፃውዒት ካብ ጫፍ ቁሪ እስካብ growing አብ ልዕሊ ,dung እና እቲ ድሌት ናብ ህላወ መሕለፊ ብውሽጢ እቲ gut ካብ -warm-blooded .animals",ከመይ ቡዙሕ ዓሌታት ካብ fungi ኣለኒ ዝነበረ recorded ካብ ?Antarctica,cyanobacteria,algae,ብዝዕባ 1150,እቲ McMurdo ደረቅ Valleys

"Along with four other scientists and various military personnel, von Neumann was included in the target selection committee responsible for choosing the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as the first targets of the atomic bomb. Von Neumann oversaw computations related to the expected size of the bomb blasts, estimated death tolls, and the distance above the ground at which the bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect.

"On 4 April 1786, Burke presented the Commons with the Article of Charge of High Crimes and Misdemeanors against Hastings. The impeachment in Westminster Hall, which did not begin until 14 February 1788, would be the ""first major public discursive event of its kind in England"", bringing the morality and duty of imperialism to the forefront of public perception. Burke already was known for his eloquent rhetorical skills and his involvement in the trial only enhanced its popularity and significance. Burke's indictment, fuelled by emotional indignation, branded Hastings a 'captain-general of iniquity'; who never dined without 'creating a famine'; whose heart was 'gangrened to the core', and who resembled both a 'spider of Hell' and a 'ravenous vulture devouring the carcasses of the dead'.

The test gave 17 whites and two Hispanics the possibility of immediate promotion. Although 23% of those taking the test were African American, none scored high enough to qualify. Because of the possibility the tests were biased in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, no candidates were promoted pending outcome of the controversy.

"A new approach to avoiding overhead wires is taken by the ""second generation"" tram/streetcar system in Bordeaux, France (entry into service of the first line in December 2003; original system discontinued in 1958) with its APS (alimentation par sol – ground current feed). This involves a third rail which is flush with the surface like the tops of the running rails. The circuit is divided into segments with each segment energized in turn by sensors from the car as it passes over it, the remainder of the third rail remaining ""dead"". Since each energized segment is completely covered by the lengthy articulated cars, and goes dead before being ""uncovered"" by the passage of the vehicle, there is no danger to pedestrians. This system has also been adopted in some sections of the new tram systems in Reims, France (opened 2011) and Angers, France (also opened 2011).

"Glass is in widespread use largely due to the production of glass compositions that are transparent to visible light. In contrast, polycrystalline materials do not generally transmit visible light. The individual crystallites may be transparent, but their facets (grain boundaries) reflect or scatter light resulting in diffuse reflection. Glass does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals and hence does not scatter light in the same manner as a polycrystalline material. The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow surface tension, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface. These properties, which give glass its clearness, can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing—i.e., colored.",145,What is in widespread use?,wire glass.n.01,schooner.n.01,Glass,double-glaze.v.01,3,"ብርጭቆ እዩ አብ ውሽጢ widespread ጥቅሚ largely መወዳእታ ናብ እቲ ምህርቲ ካብ ብርጭቆ compositions እቲ እዮም ግልፂ ናብ visible .ብርሃን አብ ውሽጢ ,ኣወዳደረ polycrystalline materials ግበር ዘይኮነ ብሓፈሻ transmit visible .ብርሃን እቲ ውልቀ ሰብ crystallites ተዝኸዉን ኩን ,ግልፂ ግን ናቶም facets (እኽሊ )ዶባት ኣንጸባርቕ ወይ scatter ብርሃን resulting አብ ውሽጢ diffuse .ምስትንታን ብርጭቆ ምግባር ዘይኮነ ይሕዝ እቲ ውሽጣዊ subdivisions ተሓባበረ ምስ እኽሊ ዶባት አብ ውሽጢ polycrystals እና በዚ ምኽንያት ምግባር ዘይኮነ scatter ብርሃን አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ማዕረ ጉዳይ ከም ሓደ polycrystalline .ናውቲ እቲ ገፅ ካብ ሓደ ብርጭቆ እዩ ኩል ግዘ ለሚፅ ካብ አብ እዋን ብርጭቆ formation እቲ molecules ካብ እቲ supercooled ፈሳሲ እዮም ዘይኮነ forced ናብ dispose አብ ውሽጢ ተሪር crystal geometries እና ይኽእል ተኸተል ገፅ ,ውጥረት አየናይ imposes ሓደ microscopically ለሚፅ .ገፅ እዚ ,ኣቕሑት አየናይ ሃብ ብርጭቆ ናቱ ,clearness ይኽእል ኩን retained ሙሉእ እንተ ብርጭቆ እዩ partially -..,light-absorbing—i.e .colored",እንታይ እዩ አብ ውሽጢ widespread ?ጥቅሚ,ገመድ ..glass.n.01,..schooner.n.01,ብርጭቆ,-..double-glaze.v.01

"An early formal system of temporal logic was studied by Avicenna. Although he did not develop a real theory of temporal propositions, he did study the relationship between temporalis and the implication. Avicenna's work was further developed by Najm al-Dīn al-Qazwīnī al-Kātibī and became the dominant system of Islamic logic until modern times. Avicennian logic also influenced several early European logicians such as Albertus Magnus and William of Ockham. Avicenna endorsed the law of noncontradiction proposed by Aristotle, that a fact could not be both true and false at the same time and in the same sense of the terminology used.

"In 1976 Montini became the first pontiff in modern history to deny the accusation of homosexuality. Published by his order in January 1976 was a homily Persona Humana: Declaration on Certain Questions concerning Sexual Ethics, which outlawed pre or extra-marital sex, condemned homosexuality, and forbade masturbation. It provoked French author and former diplomat Roger Peyrefitte, in an interview published by the magazine Tempo, to accuse Montini of hypocrisy, and of having a longtime lover who was a movie actor. According to rumors prevalent both inside the Curia and in Italian society, this was Paolo Carlini, who had a bit part as a hairdresser in the Audrey Hepburn film Roman Holiday. Peyrefitte had previously published the accusation in two books, but the interview (previously published in a French gay magazine) brought the rumors to a wider public and caused an uproar. In a brief address to a crowd of approximately 20,000 in St. Peters Square on April 18, Montini called the charges ""horrible and slanderous insinuations"" and appealed for prayers on his behalf. Special prayers for Montini were said in all Italian Roman Catholic churches in ""a day of consolation"".

"Lee has said that To Kill a Mockingbird is not an autobiography, but rather an example of how an author ""should write about what he knows and write truthfully"". Nevertheless, several people and events from Lee's childhood parallel those of the fictional Scout. Lee's father, Amasa Coleman Lee, was an attorney, similar to Atticus Finch, and in 1919, he defended two black men accused of murder. After they were convicted, hanged and mutilated, he never tried another criminal case. Lee's father was also the editor and publisher of the Monroeville newspaper. Although more of a proponent of racial segregation than Atticus, he gradually became more liberal in his later years. Though Scout's mother died when she was a baby, Lee was 25 when her mother, Frances Cunningham Finch, died. Lee's mother was prone to a nervous condition that rendered her mentally and emotionally absent. Lee had a brother named Edwin, who—like the fictional Jem—was four years older than his sister.

"The climate of New Delhi is a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cwa) with high variation between summer and winter in terms of both temperature and rainfall. The temperature varies from 46 °C (115 °F) in summers to around 0 °C (32 °F) in winters. The area's version of a humid subtropical climate is noticeably different from many other cities with this climate classification in that it features long and very hot summers, relatively dry and mild winters, a monsoonal period, and dust storms. Summers are long, extending from early April to October, with the monsoon season occurring in the middle of the summer. Winter starts in November and peaks in January.

"Mithridates the Great was the ruler of Pontus, a large kingdom in Asia Minor (modern Turkey), from 120 to 63 BC. Mithridates antagonised Rome by seeking to expand his kingdom, and Rome for her part seemed equally eager for war and the spoils and prestige that it might bring. In 88 BC, Mithridates ordered the killing of a majority of the 80,000 Romans living in his kingdom. The massacre was the official reason given for the commencement of hostilities in the First Mithridatic War. The Roman general Lucius Cornelius Sulla forced Mithridates out of Greece proper, but then had to return to Italy to answer the internal threat posed by his rival, Gaius Marius.

The album topped the charts in over 28 countries worldwide, an unprecedented achievement at the time, and became her best-selling studio album of her career to this date with sales of 25 million.

However, the opposition was stronger: it included Prime Minister H. H.

After many hearings the proposal was narrowly defeated in a Parliament committee vote in 1909. Willett's allies introduced similar bills every year from 1911 through 1914, to no avail.

"In 1963, the teenage Brian May and his father custom-built his signature guitar Red Special, which was purposely designed to feedback. Sonic experimentation figured heavily in Queen's songs. A distinctive characteristic of Queen's music are the vocal harmonies which are usually composed of the voices of May, Mercury, and Taylor best heard on the studio albums A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races. Some of the ground work for the development of this sound can be attributed to their former producer Roy Thomas Baker, and their engineer Mike Stone. Besides vocal harmonies, Queen were also known for multi-tracking voices to imitate the sound of a large choir through overdubs. For instance, according to Brian May, there are over 180 vocal overdubs in ""Bohemian Rhapsody"".

"As with any other country during the Early Modern Period, such as Italy and Spain in Europe, the Ottoman social life was interconnected with the medrese. Medreses were built in as part of a Mosque complex where many programmes, such as aid to the poor through soup kitchens, were held under the infrastructure of a mosque, which reveals the interconnectedness of religion and social life during this period. ""The mosques to which medreses were attached, dominated the social life in Ottoman cities."" Social life was not dominated by religion only in the Muslim world of the Ottoman Empire; it was also quite similar to the social life of Europe during this period. As Goffman says: ""Just as mosques dominated social life for the Ottomans, churches and synagogues dominated life for the Christians and Jews as well."" Hence, social life and the medrese were closely linked, since medreses taught many curricula, such as religion, which highly governed social life in terms of establishing orthodoxy. ""They tried moving their developing state toward Islamic orthodoxy."" Overall, the fact that mosques contained medreses comes to show the relevance of education to religion in the sense that education took place within the framework of religion and religion established social life by trying to create a common religious orthodoxy. Hence, medreses were simply part of the social life of society as students came to learn the fundamentals of their societal values and beliefs.",183,What country's social life was interconnected with the medrese?,medrese,Goffman,Christians,Ottoman,4,"ከም ምስ ዝኾነ ካልእ ሃገር አብ እዋን እቲ ብግዘ ዘበናዊ ,ግዘ ከምዚ ከም Italy እና Spain አብ ውሽጢ ,Europe እቲ Ottoman ማሕበራዊ ህይወት ኔሩ interconnected ምስ እቲ .medrese Medreses ኔሮም ተሃኒጹ አብ ውሽጢ ከም ክፋል ካብ ሓደ Mosque ሕውስዋስ አበይ ቡዙሕ ,programmes ከምዚ ከም ረድኤት ናብ እቲ ድኻ ብውሽጢ ሳሙና ,kitchens ኔሮም ተገይሩ ትሕቲ እቲ infrastructure ካብ ሓደ ,mosque አየናይ reveals እቲ interconnectedness ካብ ሃይማኖት እና ማሕበራዊ ህይወት አብ እዋን እዚ .ግዘ ""እቲ mosques ናብ አየናይ medreses ኔሮም ,ጥባቕ dominated እቲ ማሕበራዊ ህይወት አብ ውሽጢ Ottoman .""cities ማሕበራዊ ህይወት ኔሩ ዘይኮነ dominated ብ ሃይማኖት ጥራሕ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Muslim ዓለም ካብ እቲ Ottoman ;Empire እቲ ነገር ኔሩ እውን ፀጥ ዝበለ ተመሳሳሊ ናብ እቲ ማሕበራዊ ህይወት ካብ Europe አብ እዋን እዚ .ግዘ ከም Goffman :says ""ጥራሕ ከም mosques dominated ማሕበራዊ ህይወት ን እቲ ,Ottomans churches እና synagogues dominated ህይወት ን እቲ Christians እና Jews ከም .""ደሓን ,በዚ ምኽንያት ማሕበራዊ ህይወት እና እቲ medrese ኔሮም closely ,linked ካብ medreses ዝተመሃረ ቡዙሕ ,curricula ከምዚ ከም ,ሃይማኖት አየናይ highly governed ማሕበራዊ ህይወት አብ ውሽጢ ስያመታት ካብ establishing .orthodoxy ""ንሶም ሞከረ moving ናቶም developing ግዝኣት ንቕድሚት Islamic .""orthodoxy ,ጠቅላላ እቲ ሓቂ እቲ mosques contained medreses comes ናብ አርኢ እቲ relevance ካብ ትምህርቲ ናብ ሃይማኖት አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ትርጉም እቲ ትምህርቲ ምውሳድ ቦታ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ምስሊ ካብ ሃይማኖት እና ሃይማኖት ዝተመስረተ ማሕበራዊ ህይወት ብ trying ናብ ፍጠር ሓደ ልሙድ ሃይማኖታዊ .orthodoxy ,በዚ ምኽንያት medreses ኔሮም simply ክፋል ካብ እቲ ማሕበራዊ ህይወት ካብ ሕብረተሰብ ከም students መጺኡ ናብ ተመሃር እቲ fundamentals ካብ ናቶም societal values እና .beliefs",እንታይ 'country's ማሕበራዊ ህይወት ኔሩ interconnected ምስ እቲ ?medrese,medrese,Goffman,Christians,Ottoman
"Bowers confronted a similar problem in his edition of Maggie. Crane originally printed the novel privately in 1893. To secure commercial publication in 1896, Crane agreed to remove profanity, but he also made stylistic revisions. Bowers's approach was to preserve the stylistic and literary changes of 1896, but to revert to the 1893 readings where he believed that Crane was fulfilling the publisher's intention rather than his own. There were, however, intermediate cases that could reasonably have been attributed to either intention, and some of Bowers's choices came under fire – both as to his judgment, and as to the wisdom of conflating readings from the two different versions of Maggie.",184,When did Bowers confront a similar problem with Maggie?,1893,Maggie,Bowers,Crane,1,"Bowers confronted ሓደ ተመሳሳሊ ፀገም አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ edition ካብ .Maggie Crane originally printed እቲ ልበ ወለድ privately አብ ውሽጢ .1893 ናብ ውሑስ ንግዳዊ publication አብ ውሽጢ ,1896 Crane agreed ናብ ኣወግድ ,profanity ግን ንሱ እውን ዝተሰርሐ stylistic .revisions 'Bowers's ቅረብ ኔሩ ናብ ምዕቃብ እቲ stylistic እና literary changes ካብ ,1896 ግን ናብ revert ናብ እቲ 1893 readings አበይ ንሱ believed እቲ Crane ኔሩ fulfilling እቲ 'publisher's ሓሳብ ይመርፅ ካብ ናቱ .ወንን ኣብቲ ,ኔሮም ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ማእኸላይ cases እቲ ይከኣል reasonably ኣለኒ ዝነበረ attributed ናብ ወይ ,ሓሳብ እና ንእሽተይ ካብ 'Bowers's choices መጺኡ ትሕቲ ሓዊ – ክልቲኡ ከም ናብ ናቱ ,judgment እና ከም ናብ እቲ ጥበብ ካብ conflating readings ካብ እቲ ክልተ ፍሉይ versions ካብ .Maggie",መዓዝ ግቡር Bowers confront ሓደ ተመሳሳሊ ፀገም ምስ ?Maggie,1893,Maggie,Bowers,Crane
"A distinct Greek political identity re-emerged in the 11th century in educated circles and became more forceful after the fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade in 1204, so that when the empire was revived in 1261, it became in many ways a Greek national state. That new notion of nationhood engendered a deep interest in the classical past culminating in the ideas of the Neoplatonist philosopher Gemistus Pletho, who abandoned Christianity. However, it was the combination of Orthodox Christianity with a specifically Greek identity that shaped the Greeks' notion of themselves in the empire's twilight years. The interest in the Classical Greek heritage was complemented by a renewed emphasis on Greek Orthodox identity, which was reinforced in the late Medieval and Ottoman Greeks' links with their fellow Orthodox Christians in the Russian Empire. These were further strengthened following the fall of the Empire of Trebizond in 1461, after which and until the second Russo-Turkish War of 1828-29 hundreds of thousands of Pontic Greeks fled or migrated from the Pontic Alps and Armenian Highlands to southern Russia and the Russian South Caucasus (see also Greeks in Russia, Greeks in Armenia, Greeks in Georgia, and Caucasian Greeks).",185,When did the Grecian political identity re-emerge in educated circles?,second,Gemistus Pletho,Greek,the 11th century,4,"ሓደ ዝጠፈአ Greek political መንነት -re-emerged አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 11th ዘመን አብ ውሽጢ educated circles እና ኮይኑ ቡዙሕ forceful ድሕሪ እቲ ምውዳቅ ካብ Constantinople ናብ እቲ Crusaders ካብ እቲ Fourth Crusade አብ ውሽጢ ,1204 ስለዚ እቲ መዓዝ እቲ empire ኔሩ revived አብ ውሽጢ ,1261 እቲ ነገር ኮይኑ አብ ውሽጢ ቡዙሕ ways ሓደ Greek ሃገራዊ .ግዝኣት እቲ ሓድሽ notion ካብ nationhood engendered ሓደ ጥሉቅ ወለድ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ classical ሕሉፍ culminating አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ideas ካብ እቲ Neoplatonist philosopher Gemistus ,Pletho መን ምቁራጽ .Christianity ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ እቲ ነገር ኔሩ እቲ ጥምረት ካብ Orthodox Christianity ምስ ሓደ specifically Greek መንነት እቲ shaped እቲ 'Greeks notion ካብ ባዕሎም አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 'empire's twilight .ዓመታት እቲ ወለድ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Classical Greek ቅርሲ ኔሩ complemented ብ ሓደ renewed ኣትኩሮ ምሃብ አብ ልዕሊ Greek Orthodox ,መንነት አየናይ ኔሩ reinforced አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ረፋድ Medieval እና Ottoman 'Greeks links ምስ ናቶም ተኸታሊ Orthodox Christians አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Russian .Empire እዚ ኔሮም ርሑቅ strengthened ምኽታል እቲ ምውዳቅ ካብ እቲ Empire ካብ Trebizond አብ ውሽጢ ,1461 ድሕሪ አየናይ እና ክሳብ እቲ ካልኣይ -Russo-Turkish ውግእ ካብ -1828-29 hundreds ካብ thousands ካብ Pontic Greeks fled ወይ migrated ካብ እቲ Pontic Alps እና Armenian Highlands ናብ southern Russia እና እቲ Russian ደቡብ Caucasus (ረአ እውን Greeks አብ ውሽጢ ,Russia Greeks አብ ውሽጢ ,Armenia Greeks አብ ውሽጢ ,Georgia እና Caucasian ).Greeks",መዓዝ ግቡር እቲ Grecian political መንነት -re-emerge አብ ውሽጢ educated ?circles,ካልኣይ,Gemistus Pletho,Greek,እቲ 11th ዘመን

"Other authors have focused on the structural conditions leading up to genocide and the psychological and social processes that create an evolution toward genocide. Ervin Staub showed that economic deterioration and political confusion and disorganization were starting points of increasing discrimination and violence in many instances of genocides and mass killing. They lead to scapegoating a group and ideologies that identified that group as an enemy. A history of devaluation of the group that becomes the victim, past violence against the group that becomes the perpetrator leading to psychological wounds, authoritarian cultures and political systems, and the passivity of internal and external witnesses (bystanders) all contribute to the probability that the violence develops into genocide. Intense conflict between groups that is unresolved, becomes intractable and violent can also lead to genocide. The conditions that lead to genocide provide guidance to early prevention, such as humanizing a devalued group, creating ideologies that embrace all groups, and activating bystander responses. There is substantial research to indicate how this can be done, but information is only slowly transformed into action.",190,Who showed economic deterioration and political confusion were the starting points of increasing discrimination and violence?,—,—,—,Ervin Staub,4,"ካልእ authors ኣለኒ focused አብ ልዕሊ እቲ structural ኩነታት leading ሓፍ ናብ genocide እና እቲ psychological እና ማሕበራዊ processes እቲ ፍጠር ሓደ ደፋእታዊ ለውጢ ንቕድሚት .genocide Ervin Staub showed እቲ ቁጠባዊ deterioration እና political ምድንጋራት እና disorganization ኔሮም starting points ካብ increasing ምግላል እና ዓመጽ አብ ውሽጢ ቡዙሕ instances ካብ genocides እና መጠን ኣካል .killing ንሶም ምራሕ ናብ scapegoating ሓደ ጉጅለ እና ideologies እቲ identified እቲ ጉጅለ ከም ሓደ .ጸላኢ ሓደ ታሪኽ ካብ devaluation ካብ እቲ ጉጅለ እቲ becomes እቲ ,ግዳይ ሕሉፍ ዓመጽ ተቃራኒ እቲ ጉጅለ እቲ becomes እቲ perpetrator leading ናብ psychological ,wounds authoritarian cultures እና political ,systems እና እቲ passivity ካብ ውሽጣዊ እና ደጋዊ witnesses ()bystanders ኩሎም ኣዋፅእ ናብ እቲ probability እቲ እቲ ዓመጽ develops ናብ ውሽጢ .genocide ጽዑቕ ባእሲ አብ መንጎ groups እቲ እዩ ,unresolved becomes intractable እና ዓመጸና ይኽእል እውን ምራሕ ናብ .genocide እቲ ኩነታት እቲ ምራሕ ናብ genocide ምቅራብ ሓጋዚ ናብ ብግዘ ,prevention ከምዚ ከም humanizing ሓደ devalued ,ጉጅለ creating ideologies እቲ ምቅባል ኩሎም ,groups እና activating bystander .responses ኣብቲ እዩ substantial ፅንዓት ናብ ምምልካት ከመይ እዚ ይኽእል ኩን ,ምውዳእ ግን ሓበሬታ እዩ ጥራሕ ቐስ ብቐስ transformed ናብ ውሽጢ .ተግባር",መን showed ቁጠባዊ deterioration እና political ምድንጋራት ኔሮም እቲ starting points ካብ increasing ምግላል እና ?ዓመጽ,—,—,—,Ervin Staub

This marker correlates remarkably well with the distribution of Slavic-speakers today.

"On 17 March 1883, she fell down some stairs at Windsor, which left her lame until July; she never fully recovered and was plagued with rheumatism thereafter. Brown died 10 days after her accident, and to the consternation of her private secretary, Sir Henry Ponsonby, Victoria began work on a eulogistic biography of Brown. Ponsonby and Randall Davidson, Dean of Windsor, who had both seen early drafts, advised Victoria against publication, on the grounds that it would stoke the rumours of a love affair. The manuscript was destroyed. In early 1884, Victoria did publish More Leaves from a Journal of a Life in the Highlands, a sequel to her earlier book, which she dedicated to her ""devoted personal attendant and faithful friend John Brown"". On the day after the first anniversary of Brown's death, Victoria was informed by telegram that her youngest son, Leopold, had died in Cannes. He was ""the dearest of my dear sons"", she lamented.

"Since the 1988 Education Reform Act, parents have a right to choose which school their child should go to or whether to not send them to school at all and to home educate them instead. The concept of ""school choice"" introduces the idea of competition between state schools, a fundamental change to the original ""neighbourhood comprehensive"" model, and is partly intended as a means by which schools that are perceived to be inferior are forced either to improve or, if hardly anyone wants to go there, to close down. Government policy is currently promoting 'specialisation' whereby parents choose a secondary school appropriate for their child's interests and skills. Most initiatives focus on parental choice and information, implementing a pseudo-market incentive to encourage better schools.

"Southampton has always been a port, and the docks have long been a major employer in the city. In particular, it is a port for cruise ships; its heyday was the first half of the 20th century, and in particular the inter-war years, when it handled almost half the passenger traffic of the UK. Today it remains home to luxury cruise ships, as well as being the largest freight port on the Channel coast and fourth largest UK port by tonnage, with several container terminals. Unlike some other ports, such as Liverpool, London, and Bristol, where industry and docks have largely moved out of the city centres leaving room for redevelopment, Southampton retains much of its inner-city industry. Despite the still active and expanding docklands to the west of the city centre, further enhanced with the opening of a fourth cruise terminal in 2009, parts of the eastern docks have been redeveloped; the Ocean Village development, which included a local marina and small entertainment complex, is a good example.

"The creation of the public sphere has been associated with two long-term historical trends: the rise of the modern nation state and the rise of capitalism. The modern nation state, in its consolidation of public power, created by counterpoint a private realm of society independent of the state, which allowed for the public sphere. Capitalism also increased society's autonomy and self-awareness, and an increasing need for the exchange of information. As the nascent public sphere expanded, it embraced a large variety of institutions; the most commonly cited were coffee houses and cafés, salons and the literary public sphere, figuratively localized in the Republic of Letters. In France, the creation of the public sphere was helped by the aristocracy's move from the King's palace at Versailles to Paris in about 1720, since their rich spending stimulated the trade in luxuries and artistic creations, especially fine paintings.",219,How many long-term historical trends were associated with the creation of the public sphere?,Versailles,the Republic of Letters,two,Paris,3,"እቲ creation ካብ እቲ ህዝባዊ sphere ኣለዎ ዝነበረ ተሓባበረ ምስ ክልተ -long-term historical :trends እቲ ምልዓል ካብ እቲ ዘበናዊ nation ግዝኣት እና እቲ ምልዓል ካብ .capitalism እቲ ዘበናዊ nation ,ግዝኣት አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ consolidation ካብ ህዝባዊ ,ሓይሊ created ብ counterpoint ሓደ ብሕታዊ realm ካብ ሕብረተሰብ ዓርሱ ዝኸኣለ ካብ እቲ ,ግዝኣት አየናይ ተፈቂዱሉ ን እቲ ህዝባዊ .sphere Capitalism እውን ወሰኽ 'society's autonomy እና -,self-awareness እና ሓደ increasing ድሌት ን እቲ ልውውጥ ካብ .ሓበሬታ ከም እቲ nascent ህዝባዊ sphere ,expanded እቲ ነገር embraced ሓደ ገዚፍ ፍልልይ ካብ ;institutions እቲ ብጥዕሚ commonly cited ኔሮም ቡን houses እና ,cafés salons እና እቲ literary ህዝባዊ ,sphere figuratively localized አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Republic ካብ .Letters አብ ውሽጢ ,France እቲ creation ካብ እቲ ህዝባዊ sphere ኔሩ helped ብ እቲ 'aristocracy's ምንቅስቓስ ካብ እቲ 'King's palace ኣብ Versailles ናብ Paris አብ ውሽጢ ብዝዕባ ,1720 ካብ ናቶም ሓፍታም spending stimulated እቲ ንግዲ አብ ውሽጢ luxuries እና artistic ,creations ብፍላይ ደሓን .paintings",ከመይ ቡዙሕ -long-term historical trends ኔሮም ተሓባበረ ምስ እቲ creation ካብ እቲ ህዝባዊ ?sphere,Versailles,እቲ Republic ካብ Letters,ክልተ,Paris

"Hydrogen gas forms explosive mixtures with air if it is 4–74% concentrated and with chlorine if it is 5–95% concentrated. The mixtures may be ignited by spark, heat or sunlight. The hydrogen autoignition temperature, the temperature of spontaneous ignition in air, is 500 °C (932 °F). Pure hydrogen-oxygen flames emit ultraviolet light and with high oxygen mix are nearly invisible to the naked eye, as illustrated by the faint plume of the Space Shuttle Main Engine compared to the highly visible plume of a Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster. The detection of a burning hydrogen leak may require a flame detector; such leaks can be very dangerous. Hydrogen flames in other conditions are blue, resembling blue natural gas flames.

In addition, the King's right to raise taxes was abolished; no new taxes could be raised without the agreement of the nobility. Henceforth, also, district offices (Polish: ""urzędy ziemskie"") were reserved exclusively for local nobility, as the Privilege of Koszyce forbade the king to grant official posts and major Polish castles to foreign knights.

"John inherited a sophisticated system of administration in England, with a range of royal agents answering to the Royal Household: the Chancery kept written records and communications; the Treasury and the Exchequer dealt with income and expenditure respectively; and various judges were deployed to deliver justice around the kingdom. Thanks to the efforts of men like Hubert Walter, this trend towards improved record keeping continued into his reign. Like previous kings, John managed a peripatetic court that travelled around the kingdom, dealing with both local and national matters as he went. John was very active in the administration of England and was involved in every aspect of government. In part he was following in the tradition of Henry I and Henry II, but by the 13th century the volume of administrative work had greatly increased, which put much more pressure on a king who wished to rule in this style. John was in England for much longer periods than his predecessors, which made his rule more personal than that of previous kings, particularly in previously ignored areas such as the north.",240,In what kingdom did John inherit a sophisticated system of administration?,England,Hubert Walter,Treasury,John,1,"John inherited ሓደ ዝተወሳሰበ ስርዓት ካብ administration አብ ውሽጢ ,England ምስ ሓደ ግዝፈት ካብ royal agents answering ናብ እቲ Royal :ስድራ ቤት እቲ Chancery ዝተዓቀበ ዝተፀሓፈ records እና ;communications እቲ Treasury እና እቲ Exchequer dealt ምስ ኣታዊ እና expenditure ;respectively እና ዝተፈላለዩ judges ኔሮም deployed ናብ ምብጻሕ ፍትሒ አብ ከባቢ እቲ .kingdom የቅንየለይ ናብ እቲ efforts ካብ men ምፍታው Hubert ,Walter እዚ ኣንፈት ናብ ገፅ improved ቅዳሕ keeping continued ናብ ውሽጢ ናቱ .reign ምፍታው ዝሓለፈ ,kings John managed ሓደ peripatetic ቤት ፍርዲ እቲ travelled አብ ከባቢ እቲ ,kingdom dealing ምስ ክልቲኡ ወሽጣዊ እና ሃገራዊ matters ከም ንሱ .ኬዱ John ኔሩ ብጣዕሚ ንቑሕ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ administration ካብ England እና ኔሩ ዝተኻተተ አብ ውሽጢ ኩሉ ገጽታ ካብ .መንግስቲ አብ ውሽጢ ክፋል ንሱ ኔሩ ምኽታል አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ልምዲ ካብ Henry ኣነ እና Henry ,II ግን ብ እቲ 13th ዘመን እቲ ትሕዝቶ ካብ administrative ስራሕ ዝነበረ greatly ,ወሰኽ አየናይ አቅምጥ ብዙሕ ቡዙሕ ፀቅጢ አብ ልዕሊ ሓደ ንጉስ መን wished ናብ ስርዓት አብ ውሽጢ እዚ .ኣገባብ John ኔሩ አብ ውሽጢ England ን ብዙሕ longer periods ካብ ናቱ ,predecessors አየናይ ዝተሰርሐ ናቱ ስርዓት ቡዙሕ ውልቃዊ ካብ እቲ ካብ ዝሓለፈ ,kings ብፍላይ አብ ውሽጢ previously ignored areas ከምዚ ከም እቲ .ሰሜን",አብ ውሽጢ እንታይ kingdom ግቡር John inherit ሓደ ዝተወሳሰበ ስርዓት ካብ ?administration,England,Hubert Walter,Treasury,John

"John's campaign started well. In November John retook Rochester Castle from rebel baron William d'Aubigny in a sophisticated assault. One chronicler had not seen ""a siege so hard pressed or so strongly resisted"", whilst historian Reginald Brown describes it as ""one of the greatest [siege] operations in England up to that time"". Having regained the south-east John split his forces, sending William Longespée to retake the north side of London and East Anglia, whilst John himself headed north via Nottingham to attack the estates of the northern barons.

"Reform of the liturgy had been a part of the liturgical movements in the 20th century mainly in France, and Germany which were officially recognized by Pius XII in his encyclical Mediator Dei. During the pontificate of Pius XII, the Vatican eased regulations on the use of Latin in Roman Catholic liturgies, permitting some use of vernacular languages during baptisms, funerals and other events. In 1951 and 1955, the Easter liturgies underwent revision, most notably including the reintroduction of the Easter Triduum. The Second Vatican Council made no changes to the Roman Missal, but in the document Sacrosanctum Concilium mandated that a general revision of it take place. After the Vatican Council, in April 1969, Paul VI approved the ""new Order of Mass"" promulgated in 1970, as stated in the Acta Apostolica Sedis to ""end experimentation"" with the Mass and which included the introduction of three new Eucharistic Prayers to what was up to then a single Roman Canon.",255,When was the Reform of the liturgy a part of the liturgical movements?,Eucharistic Prayers,Germany,the 20th century,Paul VI,3,"Reform ካብ እቲ liturgy ዝነበረ ዝነበረ ሓደ ክፋል ካብ እቲ liturgical movements አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 20th ዘመን mainly አብ ውሽጢ ,France እና Germany አየናይ ኔሮም officially recognized ብ Pius XII አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ encyclical Mediator .Dei አብ እዋን እቲ pontificate ካብ Pius ,XII እቲ Vatican eased regulations አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ጥቅሚ ካብ Latin አብ ውሽጢ Roman Catholic ,liturgies permitting ንእሽተይ ጥቅሚ ካብ vernacular languages አብ እዋን ,baptisms funerals እና ካልእ .events አብ ውሽጢ 1951 እና ,1955 እቲ Easter liturgies underwent ,ክለሳ ብጥዕሚ notably ይሓውስ እቲ reintroduction ካብ እቲ Easter .Triduum እቲ ካልኣይ Vatican ዋዕላ ዝተሰርሐ አይኮንን changes ናብ እቲ Roman ,Missal ግን አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ሰነድ Sacrosanctum Concilium mandated እቲ ሓደ ሓፈሻዊ ክለሳ ካብ እቲ ነገር ውሰድ .ቦታ ድሕሪ እቲ Vatican ,ዋዕላ አብ ውሽጢ ጉንበት ,1969 Paul VI ጸዲቑ እቲ ""ሓድሽ ስርዓት ካብ ""መጠን ኣካል promulgated አብ ውሽጢ ,1970 ከም stated አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Acta Apostolica Sedis ናብ ""መወዳእታ ""experimentation ምስ እቲ መጠን ኣካል እና አየናይ included እቲ መእተዊ ካብ ሰለስተ ሓድሽ Eucharistic Prayers ናብ እንታይ ኔሩ ሓፍ ናብ ሽዑ ሓደ ነፀላ Roman .Canon",መዓዝ ኔሩ እቲ Reform ካብ እቲ liturgy ሓደ ክፋል ካብ እቲ liturgical ?movements,Eucharistic Prayers,Germany,እቲ 20th ዘመን,Paul VI

Many groups retained primitive characteristics, such as clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups, including modern birds (Aves). While the earliest forms, such as Archaeopteryx and Jeholornis, retained the long bony tails of their ancestors, the tails of more advanced avialans were shortened with the advent of the pygostyle bone in the group Pygostylia.

Mountains account for one third of the state's surface area which include large coniferous forests.

Precipitation and temperature in the mountainous areas depends on the elevation. Between the months of November and March snow storms are possible in the lower elevations and are frequent in the higher elevations. There are several watersheds located in the Sierra Madre Occidental all of the water that flows through the state; most of the rivers finally empty into the Río Grande. Temperatures in some canyons in the state reach over 100 °F in the summer while the same areas rarely drop below 32 °F in the winter.

Parral remained an important economic and cultural center for the next 300 years. On December 8, 1659 Fray García de San Francisco founded the mission of Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Mansos del Paso del Río del Norte and founded the town El Paso Del Norte (present day Ciudad Juárez) in 1667. The Spanish society that developed in the region replaced the sparse population of indigenous peoples. The absence of servants and workers forged the spirit of northern people as self-dependent, creative people that defended their European heritage. In 1680 settlers from Santa Fe, New Mexico sought refuge in El Paso Del Norte for twelve years after fleeing the attacks from Pueblo tribes, but returned to Santa Fe in 1692 after Diego de Vargas recaptured the city and vicinity. In 1709, Antonio de Deza y Ulloa founded the state capital Chihuahua City; shortly after, the city became the headquarters for the regional mining offices of the Spanish crown known as Real de Minas de San Francisco de Cuéllar in honor of the Viceroy of New Spain, Francisco Fernández de la Cueva Enríquez, Duke of Alburquerque and the Marquee of Cuéllar..",264,Who discovered a rich vein of silver in Camargo?,twelve years,"December 8, 1659",1631,Juan Rangel de Biezma,4,"እና .Camargo አብ ውሽጢ 1631 Juan Rangel de Biezma discovered ሓደ ሓፍታም vein ካብ ,ነሓስ እና subsequently ዝተመስረተ San Jose del Parral ጥቃ እቲ .ጣብያ Parral remained ሓደ ጠቃሚ ቁጠባዊ እና cultural ማእኸል ን እቲ ቀፃሊ 300 .ዓመታት አብ ልዕሊ ታሕሳስ ,8 1659 Fray García de San Francisco founded እቲ ተልእኾ ካብ Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Mansos del Paso del Río del Norte እና founded እቲ ንእሽተይ ከተማ El Paso Del Norte (እዋናዊ መዓልቲ Ciudad )Juárez አብ ውሽጢ .1667 እቲ ስጳኛ ሕብረተሰብ እቲ ምዕቡል አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ክልል replaced እቲ sparse በዝሒ ህዝቢ ካብ ዘይእሩም .peoples እቲ ምትራፍ ካብ servants እና workers forged እቲ መንፈስ ካብ northern ህዝቢ ከም -,self-dependent ናይ ፈጠራ ክእለት ዘለዎ ህዝቢ እቲ defended ናቶም European .ቅርሲ አብ ውሽጢ 1680 settlers ካብ Santa ,Fe ሓድሽ Mexico ድሌት refuge አብ ውሽጢ El Paso Del Norte ን ዓሰርተ ክልተ ዓመታት ድሕሪ fleeing እቲ attacks ካብ Pueblo ,tribes ግን returned ናብ Santa Fe አብ ውሽጢ 1692 ድሕሪ Diego de Vargas recaptured እቲ ከተማ እና .vicinity አብ ውሽጢ ,1709 Antonio de Deza y Ulloa founded እቲ ግዝኣት ሃብቲ Chihuahua ;ከተማ shortly ,ድሕሪ እቲ ከተማ ኮይኑ እቲ headquarters ን እቲ regional mining offices ካብ እቲ ስጳኛ ኣኽሊል ፍሉጥ ከም ሓቂ de Minas de San Francisco de Cuéllar አብ ውሽጢ ኽብሪ ካብ እቲ Viceroy ካብ ሓድሽ ,Spain Francisco Fernández de la Cueva ,Enríquez Duke ካብ Alburquerque እና እቲ Marquee ካብ ..Cuéllar",መን discovered ሓደ ሓፍታም vein ካብ ነሓስ አብ ውሽጢ ?Camargo,ዓሰርተ ክልተ ዓመታት,"ታሕሳስ ,8 1659",1631,Juan Rangel de Biezma

"On October 3, 2010, Public Safety Canada unveiled Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy, following a Speech from the Throne commitment to boost the security of Canadian cyberspace. The aim of the strategy is to strengthen Canada’s ""cyber systems and critical infrastructure sectors, support economic growth and protect Canadians as they connect to each other and to the world."" Three main pillars define the strategy: securing government systems, partnering to secure vital cyber systems outside the federal government, and helping Canadians to be secure online.

"Allusions to legal issues in To Kill a Mockingbird, particularly in scenes outside of the courtroom, has drawn the attention from legal scholars. Claudia Durst Johnson writes that ""a greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals"". The opening quote by the 19th-century essayist Charles Lamb reads: ""Lawyers, I suppose, were children once."" Johnson notes that even in Scout and Jem's childhood world, compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one's palm and laws are discussed by Atticus and his children: is it right that Bob Ewell hunts and traps out of season? Many social codes are broken by people in symbolic courtrooms: Mr. Dolphus Raymond has been exiled by society for taking a black woman as his common-law wife and having interracial children; Mayella Ewell is beaten by her father in punishment for kissing Tom Robinson; by being turned into a non-person, Boo Radley receives a punishment far greater than any court could have given him. Scout repeatedly breaks codes and laws and reacts to her punishment for them. For example, she refuses to wear frilly clothes, saying that Aunt Alexandra's ""fanatical"" attempts to place her in them made her feel ""a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on [her]"". Johnson states, ""[t]he novel is a study of how Jem and Scout begin to perceive the complexity of social codes and how the configuration of relationships dictated by or set off by those codes fails or nurtures the inhabitants of (their) small worlds.""",267,Who credited the legal scholars who have been able to access more critical readings of the novel?,Claudia Durst Johnson,Atticus,two,season,1,"Allusions ናብ ሕጋዊ ፀገማት አብ ውሽጢ ናብ ምቕታል ሓደ ,Mockingbird ብፍላይ አብ ውሽጢ scenes ደገ ካብ እቲ ,courtroom ኣለዎ drawn እቲ ቀልቢ ካብ ሕጋዊ .scholars Claudia Durst Johnson writes እቲ ""ሓደ greater ትሕዝቶ ካብ ወሳኒ readings ኣለዎ ዝነበረ amassed ብ ክልተ ሕጋዊ scholars አብ ውሽጢ ሕጊ journals ካብ ብ ኩሎም እቲ literary scholars አብ ውሽጢ literary "".journals እቲ opening ጥቕሲ ብ እቲ -19th-century essayist Charles ውላድ በጊዕ :reads "",Lawyers ኣነ ,ኢልካ ሓዝ ኔሮም ቖልዑ .""ሓንሳዕ Johnson notes እቲ ሙሉእ አብ ውሽጢ Scout እና 'Jem's ቁልዕነት ,ዓለም compromises እና treaties እዮም ወቐዐ ምስ ሕድሕድ ካልእ ብ spitting አብ ልዕሊ 'one's ከብዲ ኢድ እና laws እዮም discussed ብ Atticus እና ናቱ :ቖልዑ እዩ እቲ ነገር ትኽክል እቲ Bob Ewell hunts እና traps ደገ ካብ ?ወቕቲ ቡዙሕ ማሕበራዊ codes እዮም ዝተሰበረ ብ ህዝቢ አብ ውሽጢ symbolic :courtrooms .Mr Dolphus Raymond ኣለዎ ዝነበረ exiled ብ ሕብረተሰብ ን taking ሓደ ፀሊም ሰበይቲ ከም ናቱ -common-law ሰበይቲ እና ምህላው interracial ;ቖልዑ Mayella Ewell እዩ beaten ብ ንሳ ኣቦ አብ ውሽጢ punishment ን kissing Tom ;Robinson ብ ፍጥረት turned ናብ ውሽጢ ሓደ -,non-person Boo Radley receives ሓደ punishment ርሑቅ greater ካብ ዝኾነ ቤት ፍርዲ ይከኣል ኣለኒ ዝተወሃበ .ንሱ Scout repeatedly breaks codes እና laws እና reacts ናብ ንሳ punishment ን .ንሶም ን ,ኣብነት እሳ refuses ናብ ተኸደን frilly ,ክዳውንቲ saying እቲ ኣሞ 'Alexandra's """"fanatical attempts ናብ ቦታ ንሳ አብ ውሽጢ ንሶም ዝተሰርሐ ንሳ ምስማዕ ""ሓደ ሮዛ ሕብሪ ጡጥ penitentiary closing አብ ውሽጢ አብ ልዕሊ []"".ንሳ Johnson ,states ""[]t]he ልበ ወለድ እዩ ሓደ መፅናዕቲ ካብ ከመይ Jem እና Scout ጀምር ናብ ምስትውዓል እቲ complexity ካብ ማሕበራዊ codes እና ከመይ እቲ configuration ካብ relationships dictated ብ ወይ ፅምዲ ምጥፋእ ብ እቲኦም codes fails ወይ nurtures እቲ inhabitants ካብ ()ናቶም ንኡስ .""worlds",መን credited እቲ ሕጋዊ scholars መን ኣለኒ ዝነበረ ምኽኣል ናብ ናይ ምርካብ ዓቅሚ ቡዙሕ ወሳኒ readings ካብ እቲ ?ልበ ወለድ,Claudia Durst Johnson,Atticus,ክልተ,ወቕቲ

"Until the Church Building Act of 1818, the period saw relatively few churches built in Britain, which was already well-supplied, although in the later years of the period the demand for Non-conformist and Roman Catholic places of worship greatly increased. Anglican churches that were built were designed internally to allow maximum audibility, and visibility, for preaching, so the main nave was generally wider and shorter than in medieval plans, and often there were no side-aisles. Galleries were common in new churches. Especially in country parishes, the external appearance generally retained the familiar signifiers of a Gothic church, with a tower or spire, a large west front with one or more doors, and very large windows along the nave, but all with any ornament drawn from the classical vocabulary. Where funds permitted, a classical temple portico with columns and a pediment might be used at the west front.

"Replacing the classical physics in use since the end of the scientific revolution, modern physics arose in the early 20th century with the advent of quantum physics, substituting mathematical studies for experimental studies and examining equations to build a theoretical structure.[citation needed] The old quantum theory was a collection of results which predate modern quantum mechanics, but were never complete or self-consistent. The collection of heuristic prescriptions for quantum mechanics were the first corrections to classical mechanics. Outside the realm of quantum physics, the various aether theories in classical physics, which supposed a ""fifth element"" such as the Luminiferous aether, were nullified by the Michelson-Morley experiment—an attempt to detect the motion of earth through the aether. In biology, Darwinism gained acceptance, promoting the concept of adaptation in the theory of natural selection. The fields of geology, astronomy and psychology also made strides and gained new insights.

"In the revival movement France held a foremost place, owing to the reputation and convincing power of the orator, Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire (1802–1861). He took the habit of a Friar Preacher at Rome (1839), and the province of France was canonically erected in 1850. From this province were detached the province of Lyon, called Occitania (1862), that of Toulouse (1869), and that of Canada (1909). The French restoration likewise furnished many laborers to other provinces, to assist in their organization and progress. From it came the master general who remained longest at the head of the administration during the 19th century, Père Vincent Jandel (1850–1872). Here should be mentioned the province of St. Joseph in the United States. Founded in 1805 by Edward Fenwick, afterwards first Bishop of Cincinnati, Ohio (1821–1832), this province has developed slowly, but now ranks among the most flourishing and active provinces of the order. In 1910 it numbered seventeen convents or secondary houses. In 1905, it established a large house of studies at Washington, D.C., called the Dominican House of Studies.

"Politically, Calvin favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy. He appreciated the advantages of democracy: ""It is an invaluable gift, if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords."" Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God. To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy. Besides England, the Netherlands were, under Calvinist leadership, the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It granted asylum to philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle.

"The adolescent growth spurt is a rapid increase in the individual's height and weight during puberty resulting from the simultaneous release of growth hormones, thyroid hormones, and androgens. Males experience their growth spurt about two years later, on average, than females. During their peak height velocity (the time of most rapid growth), adolescents grow at a growth rate nearly identical to that of a toddler—about 4 inches (10.3 cm) a year for males and 3.5 inches (9 cm) for females. In addition to changes in height, adolescents also experience a significant increase in weight (Marshall, 1978).

"The final decades of the 20th century have seen the rise of a new interdisciplinary approach to studying human psychology, known collectively as cognitive science. Cognitive science again considers the mind as a subject for investigation, using the tools of psychology, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, and neurobiology. New methods of visualizing the activity of the brain, such as PET scans and CAT scans, began to exert their influence as well, leading some researchers to investigate the mind by investigating the brain, rather than cognition.

More than $400 billion were stolen from the treasury by Nigeria's leaders between 1960 and 1999.

"On 1 February 1908, the king Dom Carlos I of Portugal and his heir apparent, Prince Royal Dom Luís Filipe, Duke of Braganza, were murdered in Lisbon. Under his rule, Portugal had twice been declared bankrupt – on 14 June 1892, and again on 10 May 1902 – causing social turmoil, economic disturbances, protests, revolts and criticism of the monarchy. Manuel II of Portugal became the new king, but was eventually overthrown by the 5 October 1910 revolution, which abolished the regime and instated republicanism in Portugal. Political instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the Portuguese First Republic. These conditions would lead to the failed Monarchy of the North, 28 May 1926 coup d'état, and the creation of the National Dictatorship (Ditadura Nacional).",297,When was king Dom Carlos I's death?,Dom Carlos,Duke of Braganza,North,1 February 1908,4,"አብ ልዕሊ 1 ለካቲት ,1908 እቲ ንጉስ Dom Carlos ኣነ ካብ Portugal እና ናቱ ወራሲ ,ግልፂ Prince Royal Dom Luís ,Filipe Duke ካብ ,Braganza ኔሮም murdered አብ ውሽጢ .Lisbon ትሕቲ ናቱ ,ስርዓት Portugal ዝነበረ ኽልተ ግዜ ዝነበረ declared bankrupt – አብ ልዕሊ 14 ሰነ ,1892 እና ካልኣይ አብ ልዕሊ 10 ተዝኸዉን 1902 – causing ማሕበራዊ ,turmoil ቁጠባዊ ,disturbances ,protests revolts እና ወቐሳ ካብ እቲ .monarchy Manuel II ካብ Portugal ኮይኑ እቲ ሓድሽ ,ንጉስ ግን ኔሩ ብኽይዲ overthrown ብ እቲ 5 ጥቅምቲ 1910 ,ለውጢ አየናይ abolished እቲ regime እና instated republicanism አብ ውሽጢ .Portugal Political instability እና ቁጠባዊ weaknesses ኔሮም ልሙዕ ምድሪ ን ህውከት እና unrest አብ እዋን እቲ Portuguese መጀመርታ .Republic እዚ ኩነታት ይኸውን ምራሕ ናብ እቲ ወዲቑ Monarchy ካብ እቲ ,ሰሜን 28 ተዝኸዉን 1926 coup ',d'état እና እቲ creation ካብ እቲ ሃገራዊ Dictatorship (Ditadura ).Nacional",መዓዝ ኔሩ ንጉስ Dom Carlos 'I's ?ሞት,Dom Carlos,Duke ካብ Braganza,ሰሜን,1 ለካቲት 1908

The attack on neutral Saxony caused outrage across Europe and led to the strengthening of the anti-Prussian coalition. The only significant Austrian success was the partial occupation of Silesia.

"Infrared radiation is popularly known as ""heat radiation""[citation needed], but light and electromagnetic waves of any frequency will heat surfaces that absorb them. Infrared light from the Sun accounts for 49% of the heating of Earth, with the rest being caused by visible light that is absorbed then re-radiated at longer wavelengths. Visible light or ultraviolet-emitting lasers can char paper and incandescently hot objects emit visible radiation.

"Apple was initially reluctant to embrace mice with multiple buttons and scroll wheels. Macs did not natively support pointing devices that featured multiple buttons, even from third parties, until Mac OS X arrived in 2001. Apple continued to offer only single button mice, in both wired and Bluetooth wireless versions, until August 2005, when it introduced the Mighty Mouse. While it looked like a traditional one-button mouse, it actually had four buttons and a scroll ball, capable of independent x- and y-axis movement. A Bluetooth version followed in July 2006. In October 2009, Apple introduced the Magic Mouse, which uses multi-touch gesture recognition (similar to that of the iPhone) instead of a physical scroll wheel or ball. It is available only in a wireless configuration, but the wired Mighty Mouse (re-branded as ""Apple Mouse"") is still available as an alternative.

"Muslim engineers in the Islamic world made a number of innovative industrial uses of hydropower, and early industrial uses of tidal power and wind power, fossil fuels such as petroleum, and early large factory complexes (tiraz in Arabic). The industrial uses of watermills in the Islamic world date back to the 7th century, while horizontal-wheeled and vertical-wheeled water mills were both in widespread use since at least the 9th century. A variety of industrial mills were being employed in the Islamic world, including early fulling mills, gristmills, hullers, sawmills, ship mills, stamp mills, steel mills, sugar mills, tide mills and windmills. By the 11th century, every province throughout the Islamic world had these industrial mills in operation, from al-Andalus and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia. Muslim engineers also invented crankshafts and water turbines, employed gears in mills and water-raising machines, and pioneered the use of dams as a source of water power, used to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines.

"In 1906, precipitation hardening alloys were discovered by Alfred Wilm. Precipitation hardening alloys, such as certain alloys of aluminium, titanium, and copper, are heat-treatable alloys that soften when quenched (cooled quickly), and then harden over time. After quenching a ternary alloy of aluminium, copper, and magnesium, Wilm discovered that the alloy increased in hardness when left to age at room temperature. Although an explanation for the phenomenon was not provided until 1919, duralumin was one of the first ""age hardening"" alloys to be used, and was soon followed by many others. Because they often exhibit a combination of high strength and low weight, these alloys became widely used in many forms of industry, including the construction of modern aircraft.",322,Who discovered precipitation hardening alloys in 1906?,first,Alfred Wilm,duralumin,one,2,"አብ ውሽጢ ,1906 precipitation hardening alloys ኔሮም discovered ብ Alfred .Wilm Precipitation hardening ,alloys ከምዚ ከም ውሱን alloys ካብ ,aluminium ,titanium እና ,ነሓስ እዮም -heat-treatable alloys እቲ soften መዓዝ quenched (cooled ),ብህጹጽ እና ሽዑ harden ልዕሊ .ግዜ ድሕሪ quenching ሓደ ternary alloy ካብ ,aluminium ,ነሓስ እና ,magnesium Wilm discovered እቲ እቲ alloy ወሰኽ አብ ውሽጢ hardness መዓዝ ፀጋም ናብ ዕድመ ኣብ ክፍሊ .መጠን ሙቁት ዋላ እኳ ሓደ መግለጺ ን እቲ ኽስተት ኔሩ ዘይኮነ ተዳልዩ ክሳብ ,1919 duralumin ኔሩ ሓደ ካብ እቲ መጀመርታ ""ዕድመ ""hardening alloys ናብ ኩን ,ዘገልገለ እና ኔሩ አብ ቀረባ followed ብ ቡዙሕ .others ምኽንያቱ ንሶም ኩል ግዘ ምርኢት ሓደ ጥምረት ካብ ላዕሊ ጥንካረ እና ውሑድ ,ክብደት እዚ alloys ኮይኑ widely ዘገልገለ አብ ውሽጢ ቡዙሕ forms ካብ ,ኢንዱስትሪ ይሓውስ እቲ ናይ ህንፃ ስራሕ ካብ ዘበናዊ .aircraft",መን discovered precipitation hardening alloys አብ ውሽጢ ?1906,መጀመርታ,Alfred Wilm,duralumin,ሓደ
"During the Age of Enlightenment, Freemasons comprised an international network of like-minded men, often meeting in secret in ritualistic programs at their lodges. they promoted the ideals of the Enlightenment, and helped diffuse these values across Britain and France and other places. Freemasonry as a systematic creed with its own myths, values and set of rituals originated in Scotland around 1600 and spread first to England and then across the Continent in the eighteenth century. They fostered new codes of conduct – including a communal understanding of liberty and equality inherited from guild sociability – ""liberty, fraternity, and equality"" Scottish soldiers and Jacobite Scots brought to the Continent ideals of fraternity which reflected not the local system of Scottish customs but the institutions and ideals originating in the English Revolution against royal absolutism. Freemasonry was particularly prevalent in France – by 1789, there were perhaps as many as 100,000 French Masons, making Freemasonry the most popular of all Enlightenment associations. The Freemasons displayed a passion for secrecy and created new degrees and ceremonies. Similar societies, partially imitating Freemasonry, emerged in France, Germany, Sweden and Russia. One example was the ""Illuminati"" founded in Bavaria in 1776, which was copied after the Freemasons but was never part of the movement. The Illuminati was an overtly political group, which most Masonic lodges decidedly were not.",323,Where did Freemasons originate?,Illuminati,Scotland,One,the Age of Enlightenment,2,"አብ እዋን እቲ ዕድመ ካብ ,Enlightenment Freemasons comprised ሓደ ዓለም ለኻዊ መርበብ ሓበሬታ ካብ -like-minded ,men ኩል ግዘ ኣኼባ አብ ውሽጢ ምሽጥር አብ ውሽጢ ritualistic programs ኣብ ናቶም .lodges ንሶም promoted እቲ ideals ካብ እቲ ,Enlightenment እና helped diffuse እዚ values ሰገር Britain እና France እና ካልእ .ቦታታት Freemasonry ከም ሓደ systematic creed ምስ ናቱ ወንን ,myths values እና ፅምዲ ካብ rituals originated አብ ውሽጢ Scotland አብ ከባቢ 1600 እና ምዝርጋሕ መጀመርታ ናብ England እና ሽዑ ሰገር እቲ ኣህጉር አብ ውሽጢ እቲ eighteenth .ዘመን ንሶም fostered ሓድሽ codes ካብ ኣግባብ – ይሓውስ ሓደ communal understanding ካብ liberty እና equality inherited ካብ guild sociability – "",liberty ,fraternity እና ""equality Scottish soldiers እና Jacobite Scots ምምፃእ ናብ እቲ ኣህጉር ideals ካብ fraternity አየናይ reflected ዘይኮነ እቲ ወሽጣዊ ስርዓት ካብ Scottish ልምድታት ግን እቲ institutions እና ideals originating አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ኢንግሊሽ ለውጢ ተቃራኒ royal .absolutism Freemasonry ኔሩ ብፍላይ prevalent አብ ውሽጢ France – ብ ,1789 ኣብቲ ኔሮም ምናልባት ከም ቡዙሕ ከም ,100,000 French ,Masons making Freemasonry እቲ ብጥዕሚ ህቡብ ካብ ኩሎም Enlightenment .associations እቲ Freemasons displayed ሓደ ተፍታው ን secrecy እና created ሓድሽ degrees እና .ceremonies ተመሳሳሊ ,societies partially imitating ,Freemasonry emerged አብ ውሽጢ ,France ,Germany Sweden እና .Russia ሓደ ኣብነት ኔሩ እቲ """"Illuminati founded አብ ውሽጢ Bavaria አብ ውሽጢ ,1776 አየናይ ኔሩ copied ድሕሪ እቲ Freemasons ግን ኔሩ ፍፁም ክፋል ካብ እቲ .ምንቅስቓስ እቲ Illuminati ኔሩ ሓደ overtly political ,ጉጅለ አየናይ ብጥዕሚ Masonic lodges decidedly ኔሮም .ዘይኮነ",አበይ ግቡር Freemasons ?originate,Illuminati,Scotland,ሓደ,እቲ ዕድመ ካብ Enlightenment

"To maintain a high constant body temperature is energy expensive – mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet. While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted to meet their dietary requirements in a variety of ways. Some eat other animals – this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants. A herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as fruit-eating and grass-eating. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract, because the proteins, lipids, and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialized digestion. Plants, on the other hand, contain complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose. The digestive tract of an herbivore is therefore host to bacteria that ferment these substances, and make them available for digestion. The bacteria are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum. The size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type. Since small mammals have a high ratio of heat-losing surface area to heat-generating volume, they tend to have high energy requirements and a high metabolic rate. Mammals that weigh less than about 18 oz (500 g) are mostly insectivorous because they cannot tolerate the slow, complex digestive process of a herbivore. Larger animals, on the other hand, generate more heat and less of this heat is lost. They can therefore tolerate either a slower collection process (those that prey on larger vertebrates) or a slower digestive process (herbivores). Furthermore, mammals that weigh more than 18 oz (500 g) usually cannot collect enough insects during their waking hours to sustain themselves. The only large insectivorous mammals are those that feed on huge colonies of insects (ants or termites).",326,"Which mammals have a rich, nutritious diet?",more than 18,500,their waking hours,Other mammals,4,"ናብ ምዕቃብ ሓደ ላዕሊ ቀዋሚ ሰውነት መጠን ሙቁት እዩ ጉልበት ክባር – mammals ስለዚ ድማ ድሌት ሓደ nutritious እና plentiful .ኣመጋግባ እስካብ እቲ earliest mammals ኔሮም ናይ ምዃን ዕድል ,predators ፍሉይ ዓሌታት ኣለኒ ካብ adapted ናብ ርኸብ ናቶም dietary requirements አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ፍልልይ ካብ .ways ንእሽተይ ብላዕ ካልእ animals – እዚ እዩ ሓደ carnivorous ኣመጋግባ (እና includes insectivorous ).diets ካልእ ,mammals ዝተፀወዐ ,herbivores ብላዕ .ተኽልታት ሓደ herbivorous ኣመጋግባ includes subtypes ከምዚ ከም -fruit-eating እና -.grass-eating ሓደ omnivore eats ክልቲኡ ግዳይ እና .ተኽልታት Carnivorous mammals ኣለኒ ሓደ ቀሊል digestive ,tract ምኽንያቱ እቲ ,proteins ,lipids እና minerals ተረኺቡ አብ ውሽጢ ስጋ ይደሊ ንእሽተይ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ መንገዲ ካብ specialized .digestion ,ተኽልታት አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ካልእ ,ኢድ ይሕዝ ሕውስዋስ ,carbohydrates ከምዚ ከም .cellulose እቲ digestive tract ካብ ሓደ herbivore እዩ ስለዚ ድማ መዳለዊ ናብ bacteria እቲ ferment እዚ ,substances እና ስራሕ ንሶም ቅሩብ ን .digestion እቲ bacteria እዮም ወይ housed አብ ውሽጢ እቲ multichambered ከብዲ ወይ አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ገዚፍ .cecum እቲ ግዝፊ ካብ ሓደ እንስሳ እዩ እውን ሓደ ረቛሒ አብ ውሽጢ determining ኣመጋግባ .ዓይነት ካብ ንኡስ mammals ኣለኒ ሓደ ላዕሊ መጠነ ዝምድና ካብ -heat-losing ገፅ ስፍሓት ናብ -heat-generating ,ትሕዝቶ ንሶም ኹነታት ናብ ኣለኒ ላዕሊ ጉልበት requirements እና ሓደ ላዕሊ metabolic .መደብ Mammals እቲ weigh ዝወሓደ ካብ ብዝዕባ 18 oz (500 )g እዮም መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ insectivorous ምኽንያቱ ንሶም cannot ምፅዋር እቲ ,ዝንጉዕ ሕውስዋስ digestive ከይዲ ካብ ሓደ .herbivore Larger ,animals አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ካልእ ,ኢድ ምምንጫው ቡዙሕ ሙቀት እና ዝወሓደ ካብ እዚ ሙቀት እዩ .ዝጠፈአ ንሶም ይኽእል ስለዚ ድማ ምፅዋር ወይ ሓደ slower ጥርኑፍ ከይዲ (እቲኦም እቲ ግዳይ አብ ልዕሊ larger )vertebrates ወይ ሓደ slower digestive ከይዲ ().herbivores ,ካብዚ ተወሳኺ mammals እቲ weigh ቡዙሕ ካብ 18 oz (500 )g ብልሙድ cannot ምእካብ እኹል insects አብ እዋን ናቶም waking ሰዓታት ናብ ምጽናሕ .ባዕሎም እቲ ጥራሕ ገዚፍ insectivorous mammals እዮም እቲኦም እቲ ምምጋብ አብ ልዕሊ ዓብይ colonies ካብ insects (ants ወይ ).termites","አየናይ mammals ኣለኒ ሓደ ,ሓፍታም nutritious ?ኣመጋግባ",ቡዙሕ ካብ 18,500,ናቶም waking ሰዓታት,ካልእ mammals

"Expansion caused controversy about Yale's new roles. Noah Porter, moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership. Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative. He did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. He may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university.",331,What philosopher's presidency caused controversy about Yale's new roles?,Yale,1871 to 1886,Levesque,Noah Porter,4,"Expansion caused controversy ብዝዕባ 'Yale's ሓድሽ .roles Noah ,Porter ስነ ምግባር ,philosopher ኔሩ ፕረዝደንት ካብ 1871 ናብ .1886 አብ እዋን ሓደ ዕድመ ካብ ኣዝዩ ዘደንቕ expansion አብ ውሽጢ higher ,ትምህርቲ Porter resisted እቲ ምልዓል ካብ እቲ ሓድሽ ፅንዓት ,ዩኒቨርሲቲ claiming እቲ ሓደ ዓብይ ድሌት ምቅባል ካብ ናቱ ideals ይኸውን corrupt undergraduate .ትምህርቲ ቡዙሕ ካብ 'Porter's contemporaries criticized ናቱ ,administration እና historians ካብ ኣለኒ disparaged ናቱ .leadership Levesque argues Porter ኔሩ ዘይኮነ ሓደ -simple-minded ,reactionary uncritically ፈፀመ ናብ ,ልምዲ ግን ሓደ principled እና selective .ዓቃቢ ንሱ ግቡር ዘይኮነ endorse ኩሉ ነገር ዓብይ ወይ ምንጻግ ኩሉ ነገር ;ሓድሽ ,ይመርፅ ንሱ ድሌት ናብ ኣተግብር -long-established ethical እና pedagogical principles ናብ ሓደ ብቕልጡፍ changing .ባህሊ ንሱ ተዝኸዉን ኣለኒ misunderstood ንእሽተይ ካብ እቲ challenges ካብ ናቱ ,ግዜ ግን ንሱ correctly anticipated እቲ enduring tensions እቲ ኣለኒ accompanied እቲ emergence እና ዕቤት ካብ እቲ ዘበናዊ .ዩኒቨርሲቲ",እንታይ 'philosopher's presidency caused controversy ብዝዕባ 'Yale's ሓድሽ ?roles,Yale,1871 ናብ 1886,Levesque,Noah Porter

"The Classical era, from about 1750 to 1820, established many of the norms of composition, presentation, and style, and was also when the piano became the predominant keyboard instrument. The basic forces required for an orchestra became somewhat standardized (although they would grow as the potential of a wider array of instruments was developed in the following centuries). Chamber music grew to include ensembles with as many as 8 to 10 performers for serenades. Opera continued to develop, with regional styles in Italy, France, and German-speaking lands. The opera buffa, a form of comic opera, rose in popularity. The symphony came into its own as a musical form, and the concerto was developed as a vehicle for displays of virtuoso playing skill. Orchestras no longer required a harpsichord (which had been part of the traditional continuo in the Baroque style), and were often led by the lead violinist (now called the concertmaster).",333,When did the Classical era begin?,about 1750 to 1820,Classical,Opera,German,1,"እቲ Classical ,era ካብ ብዝዕባ 1750 ናብ ,1820 ዝተመስረተ ቡዙሕ ካብ እቲ norms ካብ ,ሕዋስ ,ገለጻ ምቕራብ እና ,ኣገባብ እና ኔሩ እውን መዓዝ እቲ piano ኮይኑ እቲ predominant keyboard .መሳርሒ እቲ መሰረታዊ forces ዘድሊ ን ሓደ orchestra ኮይኑ somewhat standardized (ዋላ እኳ ንሶም ይኸውን ዕበ ከም እቲ ውሽጣዊ ዓቅሚ ካብ ሓደ wider array ካብ instruments ኔሩ ምዕቡል አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ምኽታል ).centuries Chamber ሙዚቃ grew ናብ ይሓውስ ensembles ምስ ከም ቡዙሕ ከም 8 ናብ 10 performers ን .serenades Opera continued ናብ ,ዕበ ምስ regional styles አብ ውሽጢ ,Italy ,France እና -German-speaking .lands እቲ opera ,buffa ሓደ ፎርም ካብ comic ,opera rose አብ ውሽጢ .popularity እቲ symphony መጺኡ ናብ ውሽጢ ናቱ ወንን ከም ሓደ musical ,ፎርም እና እቲ concerto ኔሩ ምዕቡል ከም ሓደ ተሽከርካሪ ን displays ካብ virtuoso ምፅዋት .ክእለት Orchestras አይኮንን longer ዘድሊ ሓደ harpsichord (አየናይ ዝነበረ ዝነበረ ክፋል ካብ እቲ ባህላዊ continuo አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Baroque ),ኣገባብ እና ኔሮም ኩል ግዘ መረሐ ብ እቲ ምራሕ violinist (ሕዚ ዝተፀወዐ እቲ ).concertmaster",መዓዝ ግቡር እቲ Classical era ?ጀምር,ብዝዕባ 1750 ናብ 1820,Classical,Opera,German

"In Darwin's time there was no agreed-upon model of heredity; in Chapter I Darwin admitted, ""The laws governing inheritance are quite unknown."" He accepted a version of the inheritance of acquired characteristics (which after Darwin's death came to be called Lamarckism), and Chapter V discusses what he called the effects of use and disuse; he wrote that he thought ""there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited"", and that this also applied in nature. Darwin stated that some changes that were commonly attributed to use and disuse, such as the loss of functional wings in some island dwelling insects, might be produced by natural selection. In later editions of Origin, Darwin expanded the role attributed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Darwin also admitted ignorance of the source of inheritable variations, but speculated they might be produced by environmental factors. However, one thing was clear: whatever the exact nature and causes of new variations, Darwin knew from observation and experiment that breeders were able to select such variations and produce huge differences in many generations of selection. The observation that selection works in domestic animals is not destroyed by lack of understanding of the underlying hereditary mechanism.",336,"In what Darwin chapter did Darwin admit that ""the laws governing inheritance are quite unknown?""",Lamarckism,one,Origin,Chapter I Darwin,4,"አብ ውሽጢ 'Darwin's ግዜ ኣብቲ ኔሩ አይኮንን -agreed-upon መርኣያ ካብ ;heredity አብ ውሽጢ Chapter ኣነ Darwin ,admitted ""እቲ laws governing ውርሲ እዮም ፀጥ ዝበለ .""ዘይፍለጥ ንሱ accepted ሓደ ሕታም ካብ እቲ ውርሲ ካብ ዝተዓደገ ባህርያት (አየናይ ድሕሪ 'Darwin's ሞት መጺኡ ናብ ኩን ዝተፀወዐ ),Lamarckism እና Chapter V discusses እንታይ ንሱ ዝተፀወዐ እቲ effects ካብ ጥቅሚ እና ;disuse ንሱ ጽሒፉ እቲ ንሱ ሓሳብ ""ኣብቲ ይኽእል ኩን ንእሽተይ ጥርጣረ እቲ ጥቅሚ አብ ውሽጢ ናትና ዘቤት animals strengthens እና enlarges ውሱን ,parts እና disuse diminishes ;ንሶም እና እቲ ከምዚ modifications እዮም "",inherited እና እቲ እዚ እውን applied አብ ውሽጢ .ተፈጥሮ Darwin stated እቲ ንእሽተይ changes እቲ ኔሮም commonly attributed ናብ ጥቅሚ እና ,disuse ከምዚ ከም እቲ ምስኣን ካብ functional wings አብ ውሽጢ ንእሽተይ ደሴት dwelling ,insects ይኸዉን ኩን produced ብ ተፈጥራዊ .selection አብ ውሽጢ ዳሕራይ editions ካብ ,መሰረት Darwin expanded እቲ ግደ attributed ናብ እቲ ውርሲ ካብ ዝተዓደገ .ባህርያት Darwin እውን admitted ignorance ካብ እቲ ፍልፍል ካብ inheritable ,variations ግን speculated ንሶም ይኸዉን ኩን produced ብ environmental .factors ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ሓደ ነገር ኔሩ :ንፁር ዝኾነ ይኹን እቲ ብልክዕ ተፈጥሮ እና causes ካብ ሓድሽ ,variations Darwin ፈለጠ ካብ ትዕዝብቲ እና ቤተ-ፈተነ እቲ breeders ኔሮም ምኽኣል ናብ ምረፅ ከምዚ variations እና ምፍራይ ዓብይ differences አብ ውሽጢ ቡዙሕ generations ካብ .selection እቲ ትዕዝብቲ እቲ selection works አብ ውሽጢ ዘቤት animals እዩ ዘይኮነ destroyed ብ ዋሕዲ ካብ understanding ካብ እቲ underlying hereditary .mechanism","አብ ውሽጢ እንታይ Darwin chapter ግቡር Darwin ተቀበል እቲ ""እቲ laws governing ውርሲ እዮም ፀጥ ዝበለ ?""ዘይፍለጥ",Lamarckism,ሓደ,መሰረት,Chapter ኣነ Darwin

"The Fujiwara rulers failed to maintain adequate police forces, which left robbers free to prey on travelers. This is implicitly illustrated in novels by the terror that night travel inspired in the main characters. The shōen system enabled the accumulation of wealth by an aristocratic elite; the economic surplus can be linked to the cultural developments of the Heian period and the ""pursuit of arts"". The major Buddhist temples in Heian-kyō and Nara also made use of the shōen.

"The concept of 'education through recreation' was applied to childhood development in the 19th century. In the early 20th century, the concept was broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities. L.P. Jacks, also an early proponent of lifelong learning, described education through recreation: ""A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself he always seems to be doing both. Enough for him that he does it well."" Education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of life's activities. The concept has been revived by the University of Western Ontario to teach anatomy to medical students.",349,In what century was the concept of education through recreation applied to childhood development?,L.P.

"According to this school of Vedanta, all reality is Brahman, and there exists nothing whatsoever which is not Brahman. Its metaphysics includes the concept of māyā and ātman. Māyā connotes ""that which exists, but is constantly changing and thus is spiritually unreal"". The empirical reality is considered as always changing and therefore ""transitory, incomplete, misleading and not what it appears to be"". The concept of ātman is of soul, self within each person, each living being. Advaita Vedantins assert that ātman is same as Brahman, and this Brahman is within each human being and all life, all living beings are spiritually interconnected, and there is oneness in all of existence. They hold that dualities and misunderstanding of māyā as the spiritual reality that matters is caused by ignorance, and are the cause of sorrow, suffering. Jīvanmukti (liberation during life) can be achieved through Self-knowledge, the understanding that ātman within is same as ātman in another person and all of Brahman – the eternal, unchanging, entirety of cosmic principles and true reality.",351,What does the school of Vedanta believe all reality is?,smarta.n.01,Brahman,Māyā,zebu.n.01,2,"ከም ናብ እዚ ቤት ትምህርቲ ካብ ,Vedanta ኩሎም ክውንነት እዩ ,Brahman እና ኣብቲ exists ምንም whatsoever አየናይ እዩ ዘይኮነ .Brahman ናቱ metaphysics includes እቲ ጭብጢ ካብ māyā እና .ātman Māyā connotes ""እቲ አየናይ ,exists ግን እዩ ወትሩ changing እና ስለዝኾነ እዩ spiritually "".unreal እቲ empirical ክውንነት እዩ ገምገመ ከም ወትሪ changing እና ስለዚ ድማ "",transitory ,incomplete misleading እና ዘይኮነ እንታይ እቲ ነገር appears ናብ "".ኩን እቲ ጭብጢ ካብ ātman እዩ ካብ ,መንፈስ ዓርሰ አብ ውሽጢ ሕድሕድ ,ሰብ ሕድሕድ ምንባር .ፍጥረት Advaita Vedantins assert እቲ ātman እዩ ማዕረ ከም ,Brahman እና እዚ Brahman እዩ አብ ውሽጢ ሕድሕድ ሰብ ፍጥረት እና ኩሎም ,ህይወት ኩሎም ምንባር beings እዮም spiritually ,interconnected እና ኣብቲ እዩ oneness አብ ውሽጢ ኩሎም ካብ .ህላወ ንሶም ሓዝ እቲ dualities እና misunderstanding ካብ māyā ከም እቲ spiritual ክውንነት እቲ matters እዩ caused ብ ,ignorance እና እዮም እቲ ጠንቂ ካብ ,ሓዘን .ይሳቐ Jīvanmukti (liberation አብ እዋን )ህይወት ይኽእል ኩን achieved ብውሽጢ -,Self-knowledge እቲ understanding እቲ ātman አብ ውሽጢ እዩ ማዕረ ከም ātman አብ ውሽጢ ካልእ ሰብ እና ኩሎም ካብ Brahman – እቲ ,ቀፃሊ ,unchanging entirety ካብ cosmic principles እና ሓቂ .ክውንነት",እንታይ ምግባር እቲ ቤት ትምህርቲ ካብ Vedanta እመን ኩሎም ክውንነት ?እዩ,..smarta.n.01,Brahman,Māyā,..zebu.n.01

"Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) was designed by Microsoft to give higher-level access to a device's filesystem than USB mass storage, at the level of files rather than disk blocks. It also has optional DRM features. MTP was designed for use with portable media players, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the Android operating system from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol which was an evolution of MTP). The primary reason for this is that MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer.

"In May 1985, Gorbachev delivered a speech in Leningrad advocating reforms and an anti-alcohol campaign to tackle widespread alcoholism. Prices on vodka, wine, and beer were raised in order to make these drinks more expensive and a disincentive to consumers, and the introduction of rationing. Unlike most forms of rationing intended to conserve scarce goods, this was done to restrict sales with the overt goal of curtailing drunkenness. Gorbachev's plan also included billboards promoting sobriety, increased penalties for public drunkenness, and to censor drinking scenes from old movies. Although this program was not a direct copycat of Tsar Nicholas II's outright prohibition during World War I, Gorbachev faced the same adverse economic reaction as did the last Tsar. The disincentivization of alcohol consumption was a serious blow to the state budget according to Alexander Yakovlev, who noted annual collections of alcohol taxes decreased by 100 billion rubles. Alcohol production migrated to the black market, or through moonshining as some made ""bathtub vodka"" with homegrown potatoes. Poorer, less educated Russians resorted to drinking unhealthy substitutes such as nail polish, rubbing alcohol or men's cologne, which only served to be an additional burden on Russia's healthcare sector due to the subsequent poisoning cases. The purpose of these reforms, however, was to prop up the existing centrally planned economy, unlike later reforms, which tended toward market socialism.",363,Where did Gorbachev deliver a speech in May 1985 advocating reforms?,annual,Leningrad,World War I,May 1985,2,"አብ ውሽጢ ተዝኸዉን ,1985 Gorbachev ኣብፀሐ ሓደ ዘረባ አብ ውሽጢ Leningrad advocating reforms እና ሓደ -anti-alcohol ወፍሪ ናብ መሰናኽል widespread .alcoholism Prices አብ ልዕሊ ,vodka ,ወይኒ እና ቢራ ኔሮም ተሰአ አብ ውሽጢ ስርዓት ናብ ስራሕ እዚ drinks ቡዙሕ ክባር እና ሓደ disincentive ናብ ,consumers እና እቲ መእተዊ ካብ .rationing Unlike ብጥዕሚ forms ካብ rationing ዝተዳለወ ናብ conserve ሕፅረት ,ኣቕሑ እዚ ኔሩ ምውዳእ ናብ ይግድብ sales ምስ እቲ overt ሽቶ ካብ curtailing .drunkenness 'Gorbachev's ትልሚ እውን included billboards promoting ,sobriety ወሰኽ penalties ን ህዝባዊ ,drunkenness እና ናብ censor drinking scenes ካብ ዓብይ .movies ዋላ እኳ እዚ program ኔሩ ዘይኮነ ሓደ ቕጥታ copycat ካብ Tsar Nicholas 'II's outright prohibition አብ እዋን ዓለም ውግእ ,ኣነ Gorbachev faced እቲ ማዕረ adverse ቁጠባዊ መልሲ ምሃብ ከም ግቡር እቲ መጨረሻ .Tsar እቲ disincentivization ካብ ኣልኮል ምህላኽ ኔሩ ሓደ ቁም ነገር ንፋሕ ናብ እቲ ግዝኣት በጀት ከም ናብ Alexander ,Yakovlev መን ተመዝጊቡ ዓመታዊ collections ካብ ኣልኮል taxes decreased ብ 100 billion .rubles ኣልኮል ምህርቲ migrated ናብ እቲ ፀሊም ,ዕዳጋ ወይ ብውሽጢ moonshining ከም ንእሽተይ ዝተሰርሐ ""bathtub ""vodka ምስ homegrown .potatoes ,Poorer ዝወሓደ educated Russians resorted ናብ drinking unhealthy substitutes ከምዚ ከም ጽፍሪ ,polish rubbing ኣልኮል ወይ 'men's ,cologne አየናይ ጥራሕ served ናብ ኩን ሓደ ተወሳኺ ሓላፍነት አብ ልዕሊ 'Russia's healthcare sector መወዳእታ ናብ እቲ subsequent poisoning .cases እቲ ዕላማ ካብ እዚ ,reforms ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ኔሩ ናብ prop ሓፍ እቲ ነባር centrally planned ,ቁጠባ unlike ዳሕራይ ,reforms አየናይ tended ንቕድሚት ዕዳጋ .socialism",አበይ ግቡር Gorbachev ምብጻሕ ሓደ ዘረባ አብ ውሽጢ ተዝኸዉን 1985 advocating ?reforms,ዓመታዊ,Leningrad,ዓለም ውግእ ኣነ,ተዝኸዉን 1985

"A person's self-report is the most reliable measure of pain, with health care professionals tending to underestimate severity. A definition of pain widely employed in nursing, emphasizing its subjective nature and the importance of believing patient reports, was introduced by Margo McCaffery in 1968: ""Pain is whatever the experiencing person says it is, existing whenever he says it does"". To assess intensity, the patient may be asked to locate their pain on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain at all, and 10 the worst pain they have ever felt. Quality can be established by having the patient complete the McGill Pain Questionnaire indicating which words best describe their pain.",368,Who proposed the definition of pain?,10,Margo McCaffery,0,1968,2,"ሓደ 'person's -self-report እዩ እቲ ብጥዕሚ ተኣማኒ ለክዕ ካብ ,ቃንዛ ምስ ጥዕና care professionals tending ናብ underestimate .severity ሓደ ኣገላልፃ ካብ ቃንዛ widely employed አብ ውሽጢ ,nursing emphasizing ናቱ subjective ተፈጥሮ እና እቲ importance ካብ believing ተሓካሚ ,reports ኔሩ introduced ብ Margo McCaffery አብ ውሽጢ :1968 ""ቃንዛ እዩ ዝኾነ ይኹን እቲ experiencing ሰብ says እቲ ነገር ,እዩ ነባር ኣብ ዝኾነ ይኹን እዋን ንሱ says እቲ ነገር "".ምግባር ናብ ገምጋም ,intensity እቲ ተሓካሚ ተዝኸዉን ኩን ዝተሓተተ ናብ locate ናቶም ቃንዛ አብ ልዕሊ ሓደ መለክዒ ካብ 0 ናብ ,10 ምስ 0 ፍጥረት አይኮንን ቃንዛ ኣብ ,ኩሎም እና 10 እቲ ዝኸፈአ ቃንዛ ንሶም ኣለኒ ብስሩ .ተሰሚዑኒ ፅፈት ይኽእል ኩን ዝተመስረተ ብ ምህላው እቲ ተሓካሚ ውዱእ እቲ McGill ቃንዛ Questionnaire indicating አየናይ ቃላት ምሩፅ ግለፅ ናቶም .ቃንዛ",መን proposed እቲ ኣገላልፃ ካብ ?ቃንዛ,10,Margo McCaffery,0,1968

"Phage therapy is another option that is being looked into for treating resistant strains of bacteria. The way that researchers are doing this is by infecting pathogenic bacteria with their own viruses, more specifically, bacteriophages. Bacteriophages, also known simply as phages, are precisely bacterial viruses that infect bacteria by disrupting pathogenic bacterium lytic cycles. By disrupting the lytic cycles of bacterium, phages destroy their metabolism, which eventually results in the cell's death. Phages will insert their DNA into the bacterium, allowing their DNA to be transcribed. Once their DNA is transcribed the cell will proceed to make new phages and as soon as they are ready to be released, the cell will lyse. One of the worries about using phages to fight pathogens is that the phages will infect ""good"" bacteria, or the bacteria that are important in the everyday function of human beings. However, studies have proven that phages are very specific when they target bacteria, which makes researchers confident that bacteriophage therapy is the definite route to defeating antibiotic resistant bacteria.",372,What is another option being looked into for treating resistant strains of bacteria?,—,—,One,Phage therapy,4,"Phage therapy እዩ ካልእ መማረጺ እቲ እዩ ፍጥረት looked ናብ ውሽጢ ን treating resistant strains ካብ .bacteria እቲ መንገዲ እቲ researchers እዮም ተግባር እዚ እዩ ብ infecting pathogenic bacteria ምስ ናቶም ወንን ,viruses ቡዙሕ ,specifically .bacteriophages ,Bacteriophages እውን ፍሉጥ simply ከም ,phages እዮም ብግልፂ bacterial viruses እቲ infect bacteria ብ disrupting pathogenic bacterium lytic .cycles ብ disrupting እቲ lytic cycles ካብ ,bacterium phages ምጥፋእ ናቶም ,metabolism አየናይ ብኽይዲ ውፅኢታት አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 'cell's .ሞት Phages ንመፃእ ኣእትው ናቶም DNA ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ ,bacterium allowing ናቶም DNA ናብ ኩን .transcribed ሓንሳዕ ናቶም DNA እዩ transcribed እቲ ዋህዮ ንመፃእ ይቀፅሉ ናብ ስራሕ ሓድሽ phages እና ከም አብ ቀረባ ከም ንሶም እዮም ድልው ናብ ኩን ,ተለቒቑ እቲ ዋህዮ ንመፃእ .lyse ሓደ ካብ እቲ worries ብዝዕባ using phages ናብ ባእሲ pathogens እዩ እቲ እቲ phages ንመፃእ infect """"ፅቡቅ ,bacteria ወይ እቲ bacteria እቲ እዮም ጠቃሚ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ everyday ተግባር ካብ ሰብ .beings ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ studies ኣለኒ proven እቲ phages እዮም ብጣዕሚ ዝተወሰነ መዓዝ ንሶም ዒላማ ,bacteria አየናይ makes researchers ብዓርሱ ዝተኣማመን እቲ bacteriophage therapy እዩ እቲ definite መንገዲ ናብ defeating antibiotic resistant .bacteria",እንታይ እዩ ካልእ መማረጺ ፍጥረት looked ናብ ውሽጢ ን treating resistant strains ካብ ?bacteria,—,—,ሓደ,Phage therapy

"The axiomatization of mathematics, on the model of Euclid's Elements, had reached new levels of rigour and breadth at the end of the 19th century, particularly in arithmetic, thanks to the axiom schema of Richard Dedekind and Charles Sanders Peirce, and geometry, thanks to David Hilbert. At the beginning of the 20th century, efforts to base mathematics on naive set theory suffered a setback due to Russell's paradox (on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves). The problem of an adequate axiomatization of set theory was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics. But they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets—the axiom of foundation and the notion of class.",375,What did the axiomatization of mathematics model of?,about twenty years later,Zermelo,two,Euclid's Elements,4,"እቲ axiomatization ካብ ,mathematics አብ ልዕሊ እቲ መርኣያ ካብ 'Euclid's ,Elements ዝነበረ በጸሐ ሓድሽ levels ካብ rigour እና breadth ኣብ እቲ መወዳእታ ካብ እቲ 19th ,ዘመን ብፍላይ አብ ውሽጢ ,arithmetic የቅንየለይ ናብ እቲ axiom schema ካብ Richard Dedekind እና Charles Sanders ,Peirce እና ,geometry የቅንየለይ ናብ David .Hilbert ኣብ እቲ መጀመርታ ካብ እቲ 20th ,ዘመን efforts ናብ መሰረት mathematics አብ ልዕሊ ገርሂ ፅምዲ ሓሳብ suffered ሓደ setback መወዳእታ ናብ 'Russell's paradox (አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ፅምዲ ካብ ኩሎም sets እቲ ግበር ዘይኮነ ናሃቱ ናብ ).ባዕሎም እቲ ፀገም ካብ ሓደ እኹል axiomatization ካብ ፅምዲ ሓሳብ ኔሩ resolved implicitly ብዝዕባ ዒስራ ዓመታት ዳሕራይ ብ Ernst Zermelo እና Abraham .Fraenkel Zermelo–Fraenkel ፅምዲ ሓሳብ ተዳልዩ ሓደ ተኸታታሊ ካብ principles እቲ ተፈቂዱሉ ን እቲ ናይ ህንፃ ስራሕ ካብ እቲ sets ዘገልገለ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ everyday ትግበራ ካብ .mathematics ግን ንሶም ግቡር ዘይኮነ explicitly exclude እቲ possibility ካብ እቲ ህላወ ካብ ሓደ ፅምዲ እቲ belongs ናብ .itself አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ doctoral thesis ካብ ,1925 von Neumann demonstrated ክልተ techniques ናብ exclude ከምዚ sets—the axiom ካብ መሰረት እና እቲ notion ካብ .ክፍሊ",እንታይ ግቡር እቲ axiomatization ካብ mathematics መርኣያ ?ካብ,ብዝዕባ ዒስራ ዓመታት ዳሕራይ,Zermelo,ክልተ,'Euclid's Elements

Since then, a vociferous local debate has hinged on how and whether to accommodate and guide development within city limits.

"The emperor Julian made a short-lived attempt to revive traditional and Hellenistic religion and to affirm the special status of Judaism, but in 380 under Theodosius I, Nicene Christianity became the official state religion of the Roman Empire. Pleas for religious tolerance from traditionalists such as the senator Symmachus (d. 402) were rejected. Christianity became increasingly popular. Heretics as well as non-Christians were subject to exclusion from public life or persecution, but Rome's original religious hierarchy and many aspects of its ritual influenced Christian forms, and many pre-Christian beliefs and practices survived in Christian festivals and local traditions.",382,What religion became the state religion of the Roman Empire?,402,Nicene Christianity,Symmachus,380,2,"እቲ emperor Julian ዝተሰርሐ ሓደ -short-lived ሙከራ ናብ revive ባህላዊ እና Hellenistic ሃይማኖት እና ናብ affirm እቲ ፍሉይ ኩነታት ካብ ,Judaism ግን አብ ውሽጢ 380 ትሕቲ Theodosius ,ኣነ Nicene Christianity ኮይኑ እቲ ዘፍለጠ ግዝኣት ሃይማኖት ካብ እቲ Roman .Empire Pleas ን ሃይማኖታዊ ምክእኣል ካብ traditionalists ከምዚ ከም እቲ senator Symmachus (.d )402 ኔሮም .rejected Christianity ኮይኑ increasingly .ህቡብ Heretics ከም ደሓን ከም -non-Christians ኔሮም ዋና ናብ exclusion ካብ ህዝባዊ ህይወት ወይ ,persecution ግን 'Rome's ኦርጂናል ሃይማኖታዊ መራሕቲ ሃይማኖት እና ቡዙሕ aspects ካብ ናቱ ritual influenced Christian ,forms እና ቡዙሕ -pre-Christian beliefs እና practices survived አብ ውሽጢ Christian festivals እና ወሽጣዊ .traditions",እንታይ ሃይማኖት ኮይኑ እቲ ግዝኣት ሃይማኖት ካብ እቲ Roman ?Empire,402,Nicene Christianity,Symmachus,380
"The first Sky television rights agreement was worth £304 million over five seasons. The next contract, negotiated to start from the 1997–98 season, rose to £670 million over four seasons. The third contract was a £1.024 billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001–02 to 2003–04. The league brought in £320 million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004–05 to 2006–07. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis. Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid a total of £1.7 billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3 pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on Match of the Day) for £171.6 million, a 63 per cent increase on the £105 million it paid for the previous three-year period. Sky and BT have agreed to jointly pay £84.3 million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10 pm on matchday. Overseas television rights fetched £625 million, nearly double the previous contract. The total raised from these deals is more than £2.7 billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £40 million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.",383,How much was the first television rights agreement between Sky and BSkyB worth?,August 2006,the 1997–98 season,third,£304 million,4,"እቲ መጀመርታ ሰማይ television rights ውዕሊ ኔሩ ዋጋ £304 ሚልዮን ልዕሊ ሓሙሽተ .seasons እቲ ቀፃሊ ,ውዕሊ negotiated ናብ ጀምር ካብ እቲ 1997–98 ,ወቕቲ rose ናብ £670 ሚልዮን ልዕሊ ዓርባዕተ .seasons እቲ ሳልሳይ ውዕሊ ኔሩ ሓደ .£1.024 billion ዛዕባ ምስ BSkyB ን እቲ ሰለስተ seasons ካብ 2001–02 ናብ .2003–04 እቲ league ምምፃእ አብ ውሽጢ £320 ሚልዮን ካብ እቲ መሸጣ ካብ ናቱ ዓለም ለኻዊ rights ን እቲ -three-year ግዘ ካብ 2004–05 ናብ .2006–07 እቲ ነገር ሽዩጥ እቲ rights itself አብ ልዕሊ ሓደ --territory-by-territory .basis 'Sky's monopoly ኔሩ ዝተሰበረ ካብ ነሓሰ 2006 መዓዝ Setanta Sports ኔሩ awarded rights ናብ አርኢ ክልተ ደገ ካብ እቲ ሽዱሽተ packages ካብ matches .ቅሩብ እዚ ዝተፈጠረ ምኽታል ሓደ insistence ብ እቲ European ኮምሽን እቲ ንበይኑ rights ይሓይሽ ዘይኮነ ኩን ሽዩጥ ናብ ሓደ television .ድርጅት ሰማይ እና Setanta ተኸፊሉ ሓደ ድምር ካብ .£1.7 ,billion ሓደ -two-thirds ወስኽ አየናይ ምውሳድ ቡዙሕ commentators ብ ዘይተሓሰበ ከም እቲ ነገር ዝነበረ ዝነበረ widely assumed እቲ እቲ ዋጋ ካብ እቲ rights ዝነበረ levelled ምጥፋእ ምኽታል ቡዙሕ ዓመታት ካብ ቕልጡፍ .ዕቤት Setanta እውን ሓዝ rights ናብ ሓደ ንበር 3 pm ግጥም solely ን Irish .viewers እቲ BBC ኣለዎ retained እቲ rights ናብ አርኢ highlights ን እቲ ማዕረ ሰለስተ seasons (አብ ልዕሊ ግጥም ካብ እቲ )መዓልቲ ን .£171.6 ,ሚልዮን ሓደ 63 per cent ወስኽ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ £105 ሚልዮን እቲ ነገር ተኸፊሉ ን እቲ ዝሓለፈ -three-year .ግዘ ሰማይ እና BT ኣለኒ agreed ናብ jointly ክፈል .£84.3 ሚልዮን ን ዘንጊዑ television rights ናብ 242 games (እቲ እዩ እቲ ትኽክል ናብ ፈነወ ንሶም አብ ውሽጢ ሙሉእ አብ ልዕሊ television እና ልዕሊ እቲ )internet አብ ውሽጢ ብጥዕሚ cases ን ሓደ ግዘ ካብ 50 ሰዓታት ድሕሪ 10 pm አብ ልዕሊ .matchday Overseas television rights fetched £625 ,ሚልዮን ከባቢ ዕፅፊ እቲ ዝሓለፈ .ውዕሊ እቲ ድምር ተሰአ ካብ እዚ deals እዩ ቡዙሕ ካብ .£2.7 ,billion giving Premier League clubs ሓደ ማእኸላይ media ኣታዊ ካብ league games ካብ አብ ከባቢ £40 --million-a-year ካብ 2007 ናብ .2010",ከመይ ብዙሕ ኔሩ እቲ መጀመርታ television rights ውዕሊ አብ መንጎ ሰማይ እና BSkyB ?ዋጋ,ነሓሰ 2006,እቲ 1997–98 ወቕቲ,ሳልሳይ,£304 ሚልዮን
"Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms, known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term ""consumption"" came about due to the weight loss.

"Hard rock is a form of loud, aggressive rock music. The electric guitar is often emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity, and as a solo lead instrument. Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis. The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums, occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars.

"Originally, every electronic component had wire leads, and the PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component. The components' leads were then passed through the holes and soldered to the PCB trace. This method of assembly is called through-hole construction. In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the United States Army Signal Corps developed the Auto-Sembly process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and dip soldered. The patent they obtained in 1956 was assigned to the U.S. Army. With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of molten solder in a wave-soldering machine. However, the wires and holes are wasteful since drilling holes is expensive and the protruding wires are merely cut off.",390,When was the Auto-Sembly process invented?,1949,Moe Abramson,PCB,today,1,",Originally ኩሉ electronic component ዝነበረ ገመድ ,leads እና እቲ PCB ዝነበረ holes drilled ን ሕድሕድ ገመድ ካብ ሕድሕድ .component እቲ 'components leads ኔሮም ሽዑ ሓሊፉ ብውሽጢ እቲ holes እና soldered ናብ እቲ PCB .ኣሰር እዚ ሜላ ካብ ኣኼባ እዩ ዝተፀወዐ -through-hole .ናይ ህንፃ ስራሕ አብ ውሽጢ ,1949 Moe Abramson እና Stanislaus .F Danko ካብ እቲ United States ሰራዊት Signal Corps ምዕቡል እቲ -Auto-Sembly ከይዲ አብ ውሽጢ አየናይ component leads ኔሮም inserted ናብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ነሓስ foil interconnection ንድፊ እና ምትእትታው .soldered እቲ patent ንሶም ዝተረኸበ አብ ውሽጢ 1956 ኔሩ assigned ናብ እቲ ..U.S .ሰራዊት ምስ እቲ ዕብየት ካብ ፀፊሕ ጣውላ lamination እና etching ,techniques እዚ ጭብጢ evolved ናብ ውሽጢ እቲ መለክዒ printed circuit ፀፊሕ ጣውላ fabrication ከይዲ አብ ውሽጢ ጥቅሚ .ሎምዓንቲ Soldering ይከኣል ኩን ምውዳእ automatically ብ passing እቲ ፀፊሕ ጣውላ ልዕሊ ሓደ ,ripple ወይ ,ማዕበል ካብ molten solder አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ -wave-soldering .ማሽን ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ እቲ wires እና holes እዮም wasteful ካብ drilling holes እዩ ክባር እና እቲ protruding wires እዮም ጥራሕ ቁረፅ .ምጥፋእ",መዓዝ ኔሩ እቲ -Auto-Sembly ከይዲ ?invented,1949,Moe Abramson,PCB,ሎምዓንቲ
"Women in the Middle Ages were officially required to be subordinate to some male, whether their father, husband, or other kinsman. Widows, who were often allowed much control over their own lives, were still restricted legally. Women's work generally consisted of household or other domestically inclined tasks. Peasant women were usually responsible for taking care of the household, child-care, as well as gardening and animal husbandry near the house. They could supplement the household income by spinning or brewing at home. At harvest-time, they were also expected to help with field-work. Townswomen, like peasant women, were responsible for the household, and could also engage in trade. What trades were open to women varied by country and period. Noblewomen were responsible for running a household, and could occasionally be expected to handle estates in the absence of male relatives, but they were usually restricted from participation in military or government affairs.

"In Ireland comprehensive schools were an earlier model of state schools, introduced in the late 1960s and largely replaced by the secular community model of the 1970s.

"The Enlightenment – known in French as the Siècle des Lumières, the Century of Enlightenment, and in German as the Aufklärung – was a philosophical movement which dominated the world of ideas in Europe in the 18th century. The Enlightenment included a range of ideas centered on reason as the primary source of authority and legitimacy, and came to advance ideals such as liberty, progress, tolerance, fraternity, constitutional government and ending the abuses of the church and state. In France, the central doctrines of the Lumières were individual liberty and religious tolerance, in opposition to the principle of absolute monarchy and the fixed dogmas of the Roman Catholic Church.

"Darwin's barnacle studies convinced him that variation arose constantly and not just in response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. His thinking changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in fancy pigeon breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.",395,When did Darwin begin working on evolution?,Darwin,1854,Francis,Beagle,2,"'Darwin's barnacle studies ኣሚንካሉ ንሱ እቲ variation arose ወትሩ እና ዘይኮነ ጥራሕ አብ ውሽጢ ምላሽ ናብ changed .ኩነታታት አብ ውሽጢ ,1854 ንሱ completed እቲ መጨረሻ ክፋል ካብ ናቱ -Beagle-related ምጽሓፍ እና ጀሚሩ ምስራሕ -full-time አብ ልዕሊ .ደፋእታዊ ለውጢ ናቱ thinking changed ካብ እቲ ኣረኣእያ እቲ ዓሌታት formed አብ ውሽጢ ዝተገለለ populations ,ጥራሕ ከም አብ ልዕሊ ,islands ናብ ሓደ ኣትኩሮ ምሃብ አብ ልዕሊ speciation ብዘይካ ;isolation እቲ ,እዩ ንሱ ሪኤ increasing specialisation አብ ውሽጢ ገዚፍ ዝተረጋገአ populations ከም continuously exploiting ሓድሽ ecological .niches ንሱ conducted empirical ፅንዓት focusing አብ ልዕሊ difficulties ምስ ናቱ .ሓሳብ ንሱ studied እቲ developmental እና anatomical differences አብ መንጎ ፍሉይ breeds ካብ ቡዙሕ ዘቤት ,animals ኮይኑ actively ዝተኻተተ አብ ውሽጢ ተበሃጊ ርግቢ ,breeding እና experimented (ምስ እቲ ሓገዝ ካብ ናቱ son )Francis አብ ልዕሊ ways እቲ ተኽሊ seeds እና animals ይኸዉን disperse ሰገር oceans ናብ colonise distant .islands ብ ,1856 ናቱ ሓሳብ ኔሩ ብዙሕ ቡዙሕ ,ዝተወሳሰበ ምስ ሓደ መጠን ኣካል ካብ supporting .ማስረጃ",መዓዝ ግቡር Darwin ጀምር ምስራሕ አብ ልዕሊ ?ደፋእታዊ ለውጢ,Darwin,1854,Francis,Beagle

The next 400 million years included repeated, massive biodiversity losses classified as mass extinction events. In the Carboniferous, rainforest collapse led to a great loss of plant and animal life. The Permian–Triassic extinction event, 251 million years ago, was the worst; vertebrate recovery took 30 million years.

"Probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the Teletype Model 33 ASR, which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape reader/punch option. Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape. In particular, the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (Control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 (Delete) became de facto standards. The Model 33 was also notable for taking the description of Control-G (BEL, meaning audibly alert the operator) literally as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a BEL character. Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of underscore), a noncompliant use of code 15 (Control-O, Shift In) interpreted as ""delete previous character"" was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected.",406,What was the most influential single device for the interpretation of a code?,the 1980s,Control-Q,XOFF,Model 33,4,"ናይ ምዃን ዕድል እቲ ብጥዕሚ influential ነፀላ መሳርሒ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ interpretation ካብ እዚ characters ኔሩ እቲ Teletype መርኣያ 33 ,ASR አየናይ ኔሩ ሓደ printing terminal ምስ ሓደ ቅሩብ ወረቐት ካሴት /reader/punch .መማረጺ ወረቐት ካሴት ኔሩ ሓደ ብጣዕሚ ህቡብ ማእኸላይ ን -long-term program መኽዚን ክሳብ እቲ ,1980s ዝወሓደ costly እና አብ ውሽጢ ንእሽተይ ways ዝወሓደ ተሰባሪ ካብ magnetic .ካሴት አብ ውሽጢ ,ብፍሉይ እቲ Teletype መርኣያ 33 ማሽን assignments ን codes 17 (-,Control-Q ,DC1 እውን ፍሉጥ ከም ),XON 19 (-,Control-S ,DC3 እውን ፍሉጥ ከም ),XOFF እና 127 ()ምድምሳስ ኮይኑ de facto .standards እቲ መርኣያ 33 ኔሩ እውን notable ን taking እቲ መግለፂ ካብ -Control-G (,BEL ትርጉም audibly ምንቃሕ እቲ )operator ቃል ብቃል ከም እቲ ምዕራፍ contained ሓደ ክዉን bell አየናይ እቲ ነገር rang መዓዝ እቲ ነገር ዝተቀበለ ሓደ BEL .መልክዕ ምኽንያቱ እቲ keytop ን እቲ O መፍትሕ እውን showed ሓደ -left-arrow ምልክት (ካብ -,ASCII-1963 አየናይ ዝነበረ እዚ መልክዕ ከክንዲ ካብ ),underscore ሓደ noncompliant ጥቅሚ ካብ code 15 (-,Control-O ምቕያር )አብ ውሽጢ interpreted ከም ""ምድምሳስ ዝሓለፈ ""መልክዕ ኔሩ እውን adopted ብ ቡዙሕ ብግዘ timesharing systems ግን ብኽይዲ ኮይኑ .neglected",እንታይ ኔሩ እቲ ብጥዕሚ influential ነፀላ መሳርሒ ን እቲ interpretation ካብ ሓደ ?code,እቲ 1980s,-Control-Q,XOFF,መርኣያ 33

As the Anglo-Saxons became dominant in England, their language replaced the languages of Roman Britain: Common Brittonic, a Celtic language, and Latin, brought to Britain by Roman invasion. Old English had four main dialects, associated with particular Anglo-Saxon kingdoms: Mercian, Northumbrian, Kentish and West Saxon. It was West Saxon that formed the basis for the literary standard of the later Old English period, although the dominant forms of Middle and Modern English would develop mainly from Mercian.

"John Locke in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work Two Treatises of Government. In it Locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligation. Locke stood to refute Sir Robert Filmer's paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system. The theory of the divine right of kings became a passing fancy, exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it. Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas, Locke would accept Aristotle's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal. Unlike Aquinas's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from original sin, Locke believes man's mind comes into this world as tabula rasa. For Locke, knowledge is neither innate, revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason, tolerance and moderation. According to Locke, an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary, for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man.",413,Who exemplified the new age of political theory in writing Two Treatises of Government?,John Locke,Hobbes,Robert Filmer's,Aquinas,1,"John Locke አብ ውሽጢ ብፍሉይ exemplified እዚ ሓድሽ ዕድመ ካብ political ሓሳብ ምስ ናቱ ስራሕ ክልተ Treatises ካብ .መንግስቲ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ነገር Locke proposes ሓደ ግዝኣት ካብ ተፈጥሮ ሓሳብ እቲ directly complements ናቱ conception ካብ ከመይ political ዕብየት ኮነ እና ከመይ እቲ ነገር ይኽእል ኩን founded ብውሽጢ contractual .ግደታ Locke ደው ኢሉ ናብ refute ሃለቃ Robert 'Filmer's paternally founded political ሓሳብ አብ ውሽጢ favor ካብ ሓደ ተፈጥራዊ ስርዓት መሰረት ዝገበረ አብ ልዕሊ ተፈጥሮ አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ብፍሉይ ዝተወሃበ .ስርዓት እቲ ሓሳብ ካብ እቲ መለኮታዊ ትኽክል ካብ kings ኮይኑ ሓደ passing ,ተበሃጊ ዝተቓለዐ ናብ እቲ ዓይነት ካብ ridicule ምስ አየናይ John Locke treated .እቲ ነገር Unlike Machiavelli እና Hobbes ግን ምፍታው ,Aquinas Locke ይኸውን ተቀበል 'Aristotle's dictum እቲ ሰብኣይ seeks ናብ ኩን ሕጉስ አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ግዝኣት ካብ ማሕበራዊ ስኒት ከም ሓደ ማሕበራዊ .እንስሳ Unlike 'Aquinas's preponderant ኣረኣእያ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ salvation ካብ እቲ መንፈስ ካብ ኦርጂናል ,sin Locke believes 'man's ሓንጎል comes ናብ ውሽጢ እዚ ዓለም ከም tabula .rasa ን ,Locke ፍልጠት እዩ ዋላ ,innate ዝተቓልዐ እውን ኣይኮነን መሰረት ዝገበረ አብ ልዕሊ ምምሕዳር ግን ዋና ናብ uncertainty tempered ብ ,ምኽንያት ምክእኣል እና .moderation ከም ናብ ,Locke ሓደ absolute መስመርያ ከም proposed ብ Hobbes እዩ ,unnecessary ን ተፈጥራዊ ሕጊ እዩ መሰረት ዝገበረ አብ ልዕሊ ምኽንያት እና seeking ሰላም እና survival ን .ሰብኣይ",መን exemplified እቲ ሓድሽ ዕድመ ካብ political ሓሳብ አብ ውሽጢ ምጽሓፍ ክልተ Treatises ካብ ?መንግስቲ,John Locke,Hobbes,Robert 'Filmer's,Aquinas
"The slave trade was engaged in by European state and non-state actors such as Great Britain, the Netherlands, Portugal and private companies, as well as various African states and non-state actors. With rising anti-slavery sentiment at home and changing economic realities, Great Britain outlawed the international slave trade in 1807. Following the Napoleonic Wars, Great Britain established the West Africa Squadron in an attempt to halt the international traffic in slaves. It stopped ships of other nations that were leaving the African coast with slaves; the seized slaves were taken to Freetown, a colony in West Africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from Britain. Britain intervened in the Lagos Kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba Akitoye, and signing the Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos on 1 January 1852. Britain annexed Lagos as a Crown Colony in August 1861 with the Lagos Treaty of Cession. British missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland.

"On the Indian subcontinent, the Mughal Empire ruled most of India in the early 18th century. The ""classic period"" ended with the death and defeat of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707 by the rising Hindu Maratha Empire, although the dynasty continued for another 150 years. During this period, the Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions. All the significant monuments of the Mughals, their most visible legacy, date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and architectural results. The Maratha Empire was located in the south west of present-day India and expanded greatly under the rule of the Peshwas, the prime ministers of the Maratha empire. In 1761, the Maratha army lost the Third Battle of Panipat which halted imperial expansion and the empire was then divided into a confederacy of Maratha states.",416,When was the Mughal Empire ruled most of India?,Peshwas,Persian,the early 18th century,Hindu,3,"አብ ልዕሊ እቲ Indian ,subcontinent እቲ Mughal Empire ruled ብጥዕሚ ካብ ህንዲ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ብግዘ 18th .ዘመን እቲ ""classic ""ግዘ ended ምስ እቲ ሞት እና ሽንፈት ካብ Emperor Aurangzeb አብ ውሽጢ 1707 ብ እቲ rising Hindu Maratha ,Empire ዋላ እኳ እቲ dynasty continued ን ካልእ 150 .ዓመታት አብ እዋን እዚ ,ግዘ እቲ Empire ኔሩ marked ብ ሓደ highly centralized administration connecting እቲ ፍሉይ .regions ኩሎም እቲ ግዙፍ monuments ካብ እቲ ,Mughals ናቶም ብጥዕሚ visible ,መምርሕ ዕለት ናብ እዚ ግዘ አየናይ ኔሩ characterised ብ እቲ expansion ካብ Persian cultural ተፅዕኖ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ Indian ,subcontinent ምስ ጎበዝ ,literary ,artistic እና architectural .ውፅኢታት እቲ Maratha Empire ኔሩ located አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ደቡብ ምዕራብ ካብ -present-day ህንዲ እና expanded greatly ትሕቲ እቲ ስርዓት ካብ እቲ ,Peshwas እቲ ቀዳማይ ministers ካብ እቲ Maratha .empire አብ ውሽጢ ,1761 እቲ Maratha ሰራዊት ዝጠፈአ እቲ ሳልሳይ ውግእ ካብ Panipat አየናይ halted imperial expansion እና እቲ empire ኔሩ ሽዑ divided ናብ ውሽጢ ሓደ confederacy ካብ Maratha .states",መዓዝ ኔሩ እቲ Mughal Empire ruled ብጥዕሚ ካብ ?ህንዲ,Peshwas,Persian,እቲ ብግዘ 18th ዘመን,Hindu
"Hayek disapproved of the notion of 'social justice'. He compared the market to a game in which 'there is no point in calling the outcome just or unjust' and argued that 'social justice is an empty phrase with no determinable content'; likewise ""the results of the individual's efforts are necessarily unpredictable, and the question as to whether the resulting distribution of incomes is just has no meaning"". He generally regarded government redistribution of income or capital as an unacceptable intrusion upon individual freedom: ""the principle of distributive justice, once introduced, would not be fulfilled until the whole of society was organized in accordance with it.

"Because exposure to media has increased over the past decade, adolescents' utilization of computers, cell phones, stereos and televisions to gain access to various mediums of popular culture has also increased. Almost all American households have at least one television, more than three-quarters of all adolescents' homes have access to the Internet, and more than 90% of American adolescents use the Internet at least occasionally.

"The desire to explore, record and systematize knowledge had a meaningful impact on music publications. Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Dictionnaire de musique (published 1767 in Geneva and 1768 in Paris) was a leading text in the late 18th century. This widely available dictionary gave short definitions of words like genius and taste, and was clearly influenced by the Enlightenment movement. Another text influenced by Enlightenment values was Charles Burney's A General History of Music: From the Earliest Ages to the Present Period (1776), which was a historical survey and an attempt to rationalize elements in music systematically over time. Recently, musicologists have shown renewed interest in the ideas and consequences of the Enlightenment. For example, Rose Rosengard Subotnik's Deconstructive Variations (subtitled Music and Reason in Western Society) compares Mozart's Die Zauberflöte (1791) using the Enlightenment and Romantic perspectives, and concludes that the work is ""an ideal musical representation of the Enlightenment"".",429,What was a leading text in the late 18th century?,Dictionnaire de,Charles Burney's,1767,Rose Rosengard Subotnik's,1,"እቲ ባህጊ ናብ ,ዳህሰሳ ቅዳሕ እና systematize ፍልጠት ዝነበረ ሓደ meaningful ፅልዋ አብ ልዕሊ ሙዚቃ .publications -Jean-Jacques 'Rousseau's Dictionnaire de musique (published 1767 አብ ውሽጢ Geneva እና 1768 አብ ውሽጢ )Paris ኔሩ ሓደ leading ጽሑፍ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ረፋድ 18th .ዘመን እዚ widely ቅሩብ መዝገበ ቃላት ሂቡ ሓፂር definitions ካብ ቃላት ምፍታው በሊሕ እና ,ጣዕሚ እና ኔሩ clearly influenced ብ እቲ Enlightenment .ምንቅስቓስ ካልእ ጽሑፍ influenced ብ Enlightenment values ኔሩ Charles 'Burney's ሓደ ሓፈሻዊ ታሪኽ ካብ :ሙዚቃ ካብ እቲ Earliest Ages ናብ እቲ እዋናዊ ግዘ (),1776 አየናይ ኔሩ ሓደ historical ሓተታዊ መፅናዕቲ እና ሓደ ሙከራ ናብ rationalize elements አብ ውሽጢ ሙዚቃ systematically ልዕሊ .ግዜ ,ኣብ ቀረባ musicologists ኣለኒ shown renewed ወለድ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ideas እና ሳዕቤናት ካብ እቲ .Enlightenment ን ,ኣብነት Rose Rosengard 'Subotnik's Deconstructive Variations (subtitled ሙዚቃ እና ምኽንያት አብ ውሽጢ Western )ሕብረተሰብ compares 'Mozart's ምሟት Zauberflöte ()1791 using እቲ Enlightenment እና Romantic ,perspectives እና concludes እቲ እቲ ስራሕ እዩ ""ሓደ ተስማዕማዒ musical representation ካብ እቲ "".Enlightenment",እንታይ ኔሩ ሓደ leading ጽሑፍ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ረፋድ 18th ?ዘመን,Dictionnaire de,Charles 'Burney's,1767,Rose Rosengard 'Subotnik's

"North Carolina became one of the English Thirteen Colonies and with the territory of South Carolina was originally known as the Province of Carolina. The northern and southern parts of the original province separated in 1729. Originally settled by small farmers, sometimes having a few slaves, who were oriented toward subsistence agriculture, the colony lacked cities or towns. Pirates menaced the coastal settlements, but by 1718 the pirates had been captured and killed. Growth was strong in the middle of the 18th century, as the economy attracted Scots-Irish, Quaker, English and German immigrants.

"The Forbes 400 survey estimated in 2004 that Teresa Heinz Kerry had a net worth of $750 million. However, estimates have frequently varied, ranging from around $165 million to as high as $3.2 billion, according to a study in the Los Angeles Times. Regardless of which figure is correct, Kerry was the wealthiest U.S. Senator while serving in the Senate. Independent of Heinz, Kerry is wealthy in his own right, and is the beneficiary of at least four trusts inherited from Forbes family relatives, including his mother, Rosemary Forbes Kerry, who died in 2002. Forbes magazine (named for the Forbes family of publishers, unrelated to Kerry) estimated that if elected, and if Heinz family assets were included, Kerry would have been the third-richest U.S. President in history, when adjusted for inflation. This assessment was based on Heinz and Kerry's combined assets, but the couple signed a prenuptial agreement that keeps their assets separate. Kerry's financial disclosure form for 2011 put his personal assets in the range of $230,000,000 to $320,000,000, including the assets of his spouse and any dependent children. This included slightly more than three million dollars worth of H. J.

For instance, the San Bruno Habitat Conservation Plan/ Incidental Take Permit is good for 30 years and the Wal-Mart store (in Florida) permit expires after one year. Because the permit is issued by a federal agency to a private party, it is a federal action-which means other federal laws can apply, such as the National Environmental Policy Act or NEPA.

On 21 July 1789, after receiving news of the Storming of the Bastille in Paris, a crowd of people stormed the Strasbourg city hall, forcing the city administrators to flee and putting symbolically an end to the feudal system in Alsace. In 1792, Rouget de Lisle composed in Strasbourg the Revolutionary marching song ""La Marseillaise"" (as Marching song for the Army of the Rhine), which later became the anthem of France. ""La Marseillaise"" was played for the first time in April of that year in front of the mayor of Strasbourg Philippe-Frédéric de Dietrich.

"Because sexual orientation is complex and multi-dimensional, some academics and researchers, especially in queer studies, have argued that it is a historical and social construction. In 1976, philosopher and historian Michel Foucault argued in The History of Sexuality that homosexuality as an identity did not exist in the eighteenth century; that people instead spoke of ""sodomy,"" which referred to sexual acts. Sodomy was a crime that was often ignored, but sometimes punished severely (see sodomy law).

The general Arab reaction was one of mourning, with thousands of people pouring onto the streets of major cities throughout the Arab world. Over a dozen people were killed in Beirut as a result of the chaos, and in Jerusalem, roughly 75,000 Arabs marched through the Old City chanting, ""Nasser will never die."" As a testament to his unchallenged leadership of the Arab people, following his death, the headline of the Lebanese Le Jour read, ""One hundred million human beings—the Arabs—are orphans.""

"In 2005, the Office of Fair Trading found fifty independent schools, including Eton, to have breached the Competition Act by ""regularly and systematically"" exchanging information about planned increases in school fees, which was collated and distributed among the schools by the bursar at Sevenoaks School. Following the investigation by the OFT, each school was required to pay around £70,000, totalling around £3.5 million, significantly less than the maximum possible fine. In addition, the schools together agreed to contribute another £3m to a new charitable educational fund. The incident raised concerns over whether the charitable status of independent schools such as Eton should be reconsidered, and perhaps revoked. However, Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, saying, ""They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.""",448,When was the Office of Fair Trading found fifty independent schools to have breached the Competition Act?,the Office of Fair Trading,"around £70,000",the Competition Act,2005,4,"አብ ውሽጢ ,2005 እቲ ቤት-ፅሕፈት ካብ ፍትሓዊ Trading ተረኺቡ ሓምሳ ዓርሱ ዝኸኣለ ,schools ይሓውስ ,Eton ናብ ኣለኒ breached እቲ ውድድር ፍፃመ ብ ""ብስሩዕ እና ""systematically exchanging ሓበሬታ ብዝዕባ planned increases አብ ውሽጢ ቤት ትምህርቲ ,fees አየናይ ኔሩ collated እና distributed ካብዞም እቲ schools ብ እቲ bursar ኣብ Sevenoaks .ቤት ትምህርቲ ምኽታል እቲ investigation ብ እቲ ,OFT ሕድሕድ ቤት ትምህርቲ ኔሩ ዘድሊ ናብ ክፈል አብ ከባቢ ,,£70,000 totalling አብ ከባቢ .£3.5 ,ሚልዮን significantly ዝወሓደ ካብ እቲ maximum ዝከኣል .ደሓን አብ ውሽጢ ,ተወሳኺ እቲ schools ብሓባር agreed ናብ ኣዋፅእ ካልእ £3m ናብ ሓደ ሓድሽ charitable educational .fund እቲ ፍጻመ ተሰአ concerns ልዕሊ ዶ እቲ charitable ኩነታት ካብ ዓርሱ ዝኸኣለ schools ከምዚ ከም Eton ይሓይሽ ኩን ,reconsidered እና ምናልባት .revoked ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ Jean ,Scott እቲ ርእሲ ካብ እቲ ዓርሱ ዝኸኣለ Schools ,ዋዕላ ኢሉ እቲ ዓርሱ ዝኸኣለ schools ዝነበረ ወትሪ ዝነበረ exempt ካብ -anti-cartel ስርዓታት applied ናብ ,ስራሕቲ ንግዲ ኔሮም ምኽታል ሓደ -long-established መስርዕ አብ ውሽጢ sharing እቲ ሓበሬታ ምስ ሕድሕድ ,ካልእ እና እቲ ንሶም ኔሮም unaware ካብ እቲ ለውጢ ናብ እቲ ሕጊ (አብ ልዕሊ አየናይ ንሶም ዝነበረ ዘይኮነ ዝነበረ ).consulted እሳ ጽሒፉ ናብ John ,Vickers እቲ OFT -,director-general ,saying ""ንሶም እዮም ዘይኮነ ሓደ ጉጅለ ካብ businessmen ኣኼባ ብድሕሪ closed doors ናብ ዓዕሪ እቲ ዋጋ ካብ ናቶም products ናብ እቲ disadvantage ካብ እቲ .consumer ንሶም እዮም schools እቲ ኣለኒ ፀጥ ዝበለ openly continued ናብ ተኸተል ሓደ -long-established ትግበራ ምኽንያቱ ንሶም ኔሮም unaware እቲ እቲ ሕጊ ዝነበረ .""changed",መዓዝ ኔሩ እቲ ቤት-ፅሕፈት ካብ ፍትሓዊ Trading ተረኺቡ ሓምሳ ዓርሱ ዝኸኣለ schools ናብ ኣለኒ breached እቲ ውድድር ?ፍፃመ,እቲ ቤት-ፅሕፈት ካብ ፍትሓዊ Trading,"አብ ከባቢ ,£70,000",እቲ ውድድር ፍፃመ,2005

Less than a year later, on 11 December 1936, Edward VIII abdicated in order to marry his mistress, Wallis Simpson, who was divorced from her first husband and divorcing her second. Edward had been advised by British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin that he could not remain king and marry a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands. Edward chose abdication in preference to abandoning his marriage plans. Thus Albert became king, a position he was reluctant to accept. The day before the abdication, he went to London to see his mother, Queen Mary.

"Besides singing Madonna has the ability to play several musical instruments. She learned to play drum and guitar from her then-boyfriend Dan Gilroy in the late 1970s before joining the Breakfast Club line-up as the drummer. This helped her to form the band Emmy, where she performed as the guitarist and lead vocalist. Madonna later played guitar on her demo recordings. On the liner notes of Pre-Madonna, Stephen Bray wrote: ""I've always thought she passed up a brilliant career as a rhythm guitarist."" After her career breakthrough, Madonna focused mainly in singing but was also credited for playing cowbell on Madonna (1983) and synthesizer on Like a Prayer (1989). In 1999, Madonna had studied for three months to play the violin for the role as a violin teacher in the film Music of the Heart, before eventually leaving the project. After two decades, Madonna decided to perform with guitar again during the promotion of Music (2000). She took further lessons from guitarist Monte Pittman to improve her guitar skill. Since then Madonna has played guitar on every tour, as well as her studio albums. At the 2002 Orville H.

This ammunition consists of depleted uranium (DU) alloyed with 1–2% other elements, such as titanium or molybdenum.

Tank armor and other removable vehicle armor can also be hardened with depleted uranium plates.

"In late 1975, Queen recorded and released A Night at the Opera, taking its name from the popular Marx Brothers movie. At the time, it was the most expensive album ever produced. Like its predecessor, the album features diverse musical styles and experimentation with stereo sound. In ""The Prophet's Song"", an eight-minute epic, the middle section is a canon, with simple phrases layered to create a full-choral sound. The Mercury penned ballad, ""Love of My Life"", featured a harp and overdubbed vocal harmonies. The album was very successful in Britain, and went triple platinum in the United States. The British public voted it the 13th greatest album of all time in a 2004 Channel 4 poll. It has also ranked highly in international polls; in a worldwide Guinness poll, it was voted the 19th greatest of all time, while an ABC poll saw the Australian public vote it the 28th greatest of all time. A Night at the Opera has frequently appeared in ""greatest albums"" lists reflecting the opinions of critics.

"Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. Studies have shown that in some cases, differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels, which are important in the mate selection process. One final mechanism for coat color variation is physiological response purposes, such as temperature regulation in tropical or arctic environments. Although much has been observed about color variation, much of the genetic that link coat color to genes is still unknown. The genetic sites where pigmentation genes are found are known to affect phenotype by: 1) altering the spatial distribution of pigmentation of the hairs, and 2) altering the density and distribution of the hairs. Quantitative trait mapping is being used to better understand the distribution of loci responsible for pigmentation variation. However, although the genetic sites are known, there is still much to learn about how these genes are expressed.",459,What is another name for mammalian hair?,pelage,1,One,arctic,1,"Mammalian ,ፀጉሪ እውን ፍሉጥ ከም ,pelage ይኽእል ይፈላለ አብ ውሽጢ ሕብሪ አብ መንጎ ,populations organisms አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ,በዝሒ ህዝቢ እና ሙሉእ አብ ልዕሊ እቲ ውልቀ ሰብ .organism -Light-dark ሕብሪ variation እዩ ልሙድ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ mammalian .taxa ,ሓደ ሓደ ግዘ እዚ ሕብሪ variation እዩ ብጉስ ብ ዕድመ ,variation ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ አብ ውሽጢ ካልእ ,cases እቲ ነገር እዩ ብጉስ ብ ካልእ .factors Selective ,pressures ከምዚ ከም ecological interactions ምስ ካልእ populations ወይ environmental ,ኩነታት ኩል ግዘ ምራሕ ናብ እቲ variation አብ ውሽጢ mammalian .coloration እዚ selective pressures favor ውሱን colors አብ ውሽጢ ስርዓት ናብ ወስኽ .survival Camouflage እዩ ሓሳብ ናብ ኩን ሓደ ዋና selection ፀቅጢ shaping coloration አብ ውሽጢ ,mammals ዋላ እኳ ኣብቲ እዩ እውን ማስረጃ እቲ sexual ,selection ,ሓሳብ ንሓሳብ ምልውዋጥ እና physiological processes ተዝኸዉን ተፅዕኖ እቲ ደፋእታዊ ለውጢ ካብ coloration ከም .ደሓን Camouflage እዩ እቲ ብጥዕሚ predominant mechanism ን ሕብሪ ,variation ከም እቲ ነገር aids አብ ውሽጢ እቲ concealment ካብ እቲ organisms ካብ predators ወይ ካብ ናቶም .ግዳይ ኮት ሕብሪ ይኽእል እውን ኩን ን intraspecies ሓሳብ ንሓሳብ ምልውዋጥ ከምዚ ከም ምኸዳን members ካብ ናቶም ዓሌታት ብዝዕባ ,predators indicating ጥዕና ን reproductive ,purposes communicating አብ መንጎ ኣዶ እና ,ንእሽተይ እና intimidating .predators Studies ኣለኒ shown እቲ አብ ውሽጢ ንእሽተይ ,cases differences አብ ውሽጢ ኣንስተይቲ እና ተባዕታይ ኮት ሕብሪ ይከኣል ምምልካት ሓበሬታ ኣመጋግባ እና hormone ,levels አየናይ እዮም ጠቃሚ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ መሓዛ selection .ከይዲ ሓደ final mechanism ን ኮት ሕብሪ variation እዩ physiological ምላሽ ,purposes ከምዚ ከም መጠን ሙቁት regulation አብ ውሽጢ tropical ወይ arctic .environments ዋላ እኳ ብዙሕ ኣለዎ ዝነበረ observed ብዝዕባ ሕብሪ ,variation ብዙሕ ካብ እቲ genetic እቲ ሊንክ ኮት ሕብሪ ናብ genes እዩ እስካብ ሕዚ .ዘይፍለጥ እቲ genetic sites አበይ pigmentation genes እዮም ተረኺቡ እዮም ፍሉጥ ናብ ፅለው phenotype :ብ )1 altering እቲ spatial ምክፍፋል ካብ pigmentation ካብ እቲ ,hairs እና )2 altering እቲ ፃዕቒ እና ምክፍፋል ካብ እቲ .hairs Quantitative ባህሪ mapping እዩ ፍጥረት ዘገልገለ ናብ ዝሓሸ ተረዳእ እቲ ምክፍፋል ካብ loci ሓላፍነት ዝወስድ ን pigmentation .variation ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ዋላ እኳ እቲ genetic sites እዮም ,ፍሉጥ ኣብቲ እዩ እስካብ ሕዚ ብዙሕ ናብ ተመሃር ብዝዕባ ከመይ እዚ genes እዮም .expressed",እንታይ እዩ ካልእ ሽም ን mammalian ?ፀጉሪ,pelage,1,ሓደ,arctic

"The school broke off from the University of Deseret and became Brigham Young Academy, with classes commencing on January 3, 1876. Warren Dusenberry served as interim principal of the school for several months until April 1876 when Brigham Young's choice for principal arrived—a German immigrant named Karl Maeser. Under Maeser's direction the school educated many luminaries including future U.S. Supreme Court Justice George Sutherland and future U.S. Senator Reed Smoot among others. The school, however, did not become a university until the end of Benjamin Cluff, Jr's term at the helm of the institution. At that time, the school was also still privately supported by members of the community and was not absorbed and sponsored officially by the LDS Church until July 18, 1896. A series of odd managerial decisions by Cluff led to his demotion; however, in his last official act, he proposed to the Board that the Academy be named ""Brigham Young University"". The suggestion received a large amount of opposition, with many members of the Board saying that the school wasn't large enough to be a university, but the decision ultimately passed. One opponent to the decision, Anthon H. Lund, later said, ""I hope their head will grow big enough for their hat.""",462,When was Brigham Young Academy formed?,Cluff,Jr,German,"January 3, 1876",4,"እቲ ቤት ትምህርቲ ተሰይሩ ምጥፋእ ካብ እቲ ዩኒቨርሲቲ ካብ Deseret እና ኮይኑ Brigham ንእሽተይ ,Academy ምስ classes commencing አብ ልዕሊ ጥሪ ,3 .1876 Warren Dusenberry served ከም interim ርእሰ መምህር ካብ እቲ ቤት ትምህርቲ ን ቡዙሓት months ክሳብ ጉንበት 1876 መዓዝ Brigham 'Young's ምርጫ ን ርእሰ መምህር arrived—a German immigrant named Karl .Maeser ትሕቲ 'Maeser's ኣንፈት እቲ ቤት ትምህርቲ educated ቡዙሕ luminaries ይሓውስ መፃእ ..U.S Supreme ቤት ፍርዲ ፍትሒ George Sutherland እና መፃእ ..U.S Senator Reed Smoot ካብዞም .others እቲ ,ቤት ትምህርቲ ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ ግቡር ዘይኮነ ምዃን ሓደ ዩኒቨርሲቲ ክሳብ እቲ መወዳእታ ካብ Benjamin ,Cluff 'Jr's ቃል ኣብ እቲ helm ካብ እቲ .institution ኣብ እቲ ,ግዜ እቲ ቤት ትምህርቲ ኔሩ እውን እስካብ ሕዚ privately supported ብ members ካብ እቲ ማሕበረሰብ እና ኔሩ ዘይኮነ absorbed እና sponsored officially ብ እቲ LDS ቤተ ክርስትያን ክሳብ ሓምለ ,18 .1896 ሓደ ተኸታታሊ ካብ ጎደሎ managerial decisions ብ Cluff መረሐ ናብ ናቱ ;demotion ,ዋላኳ ተኾነ አብ ውሽጢ ናቱ መጨረሻ ዘፍለጠ ,ፍፃመ ንሱ proposed ናብ እቲ ፀፊሕ ጣውላ እቲ እቲ Academy ኩን named ""Brigham ንእሽተይ "".ዩኒቨርሲቲ እቲ ምኽሪ ዝተቀበለ ሓደ ገዚፍ መጠን ካብ ,opposition ምስ ቡዙሕ members ካብ እቲ ፀፊሕ ጣውላ saying እቲ እቲ ቤት ትምህርቲ 'wasn't ገዚፍ እኹል ናብ ኩን ሓደ ,ዩኒቨርሲቲ ግን እቲ ውሳነ ultimately .ሓሊፉ ሓደ opponent ናብ እቲ ,ውሳነ Anthon .H ,Lund ዳሕራይ ,ኢሉ ""ኣነ ተስፋ ናቶም ርእሲ ንመፃእ ዕበ ዓብይ እኹል ን ናቶም .""hat",መዓዝ ኔሩ Brigham ንእሽተይ Academy ?formed,Cluff,Jr,German,"ጥሪ ,3 1876"
"In the latter half of his career Hayek made a number of contributions to social and political philosophy, which he based on his views on the limits of human knowledge, and the idea of spontaneous order in social institutions. He argues in favour of a society organised around a market order, in which the apparatus of state is employed almost (though not entirely) exclusively to enforce the legal order (consisting of abstract rules, and not particular commands) necessary for a market of free individuals to function. These ideas were informed by a moral philosophy derived from epistemological concerns regarding the inherent limits of human knowledge. Hayek argued that his ideal individualistic, free-market polity would be self-regulating to such a degree that it would be 'a society which does not depend for its functioning on our finding good men for running it'.",463,In what half of Hayek's career did he focus on the limits of human knowledge?,the latter half,—,Hayek,—,1,"አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ጸኒሑ ፍርቂ ካብ ናቱ ሞያ Hayek ዝተሰርሐ ሓደ ቑጽሪ ካብ contributions ናብ ማሕበራዊ እና political ,ፍልስፍና አየናይ ንሱ መሰረት ዝገበረ አብ ልዕሊ ናቱ views አብ ልዕሊ እቲ limits ካብ ሰብ ,ፍልጠት እና እቲ ሓሳብ ካብ ብዘይምቁራጽ ስርዓት አብ ውሽጢ ማሕበራዊ .institutions ንሱ argues አብ ውሽጢ ፍትወት ካብ ሓደ ሕብረተሰብ organised አብ ከባቢ ሓደ ዕዳጋ ,ስርዓት አብ ውሽጢ አየናይ እቲ apparatus ካብ ግዝኣት እዩ employed ዳርጋ (እኳ ዘይኮነ )entirely exclusively ናብ enforce እቲ ሕጋዊ ስርዓት (consisting ካብ መመላኽዒ ,ስርዓታት እና ዘይኮነ ብፍሉይ )commands አድላዩ ን ሓደ ዕዳጋ ካብ ነፃ individuals ናብ .ተግባር እዚ ideas ኔሮም informed ብ ሓደ ስነ ምግባር ፍልስፍና derived ካብ epistemological concerns ብዛዕባ እቲ inherent limits ካብ ሰብ .ፍልጠት Hayek argued እቲ ናቱ ተስማዕማዒ ,individualistic -free-market polity ይኸውን ኩን -self-regulating ናብ ከምዚ ሓደ መዐቀኒ እቲ እቲ ነገር ይኸውን ኩን 'ሓደ ሕብረተሰብ አየናይ ምግባር ዘይኮነ ይጽጋዕ ን ናቱ functioning አብ ልዕሊ ናትና finding ፅቡቅ men ን ምጉያይ '.እቲ ነገር",አብ ውሽጢ እንታይ ፍርቂ ካብ 'Hayek's ሞያ ግቡር ንሱ ቀልቢ ምግባር አብ ልዕሊ እቲ limits ካብ ሰብ ?ፍልጠት,እቲ ጸኒሑ ፍርቂ,—,Hayek,—

"Anglo-Saxons arrived as Roman power waned in the 5th century AD. Initially, their arrival seems to have been at the invitation of the Britons as mercenaries to repulse incursions by the Hiberni and Picts. In time, Anglo-Saxon demands on the British became so great that they came to culturally dominate the bulk of southern Great Britain, though recent genetic evidence suggests Britons still formed the bulk of the population. This dominance creating what is now England and leaving culturally British enclaves only in the north of what is now England, in Cornwall and what is now known as Wales. Ireland had been unaffected by the Romans except, significantly, having been Christianised, traditionally by the Romano-Briton, Saint Patrick. As Europe, including Britain, descended into turmoil following the collapse of Roman civilisation, an era known as the Dark Ages, Ireland entered a golden age and responded with missions (first to Great Britain and then to the continent), the founding of monasteries and universities. These were later joined by Anglo-Saxon missions of a similar nature.",467,When did Anglo-Saxons arrive in England?,Ireland,Hiberni,the 5th century AD,British,3,"-Anglo-Saxons በፂሑ ከም Roman ሓይሊ waned አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 5th ዘመን .AD ,Initially ናቶም ምምጻእ ይመስል ናብ ኣለኒ ዝነበረ ኣብ እቲ ዕድመ ካብ እቲ Britons ከም mercenaries ናብ repulse incursions ብ እቲ Hiberni እና .Picts አብ ውሽጢ ,ግዜ -Anglo-Saxon demands አብ ልዕሊ እቲ British ኮይኑ ስለዚ ምዑዝ እቲ ንሶም መጺኡ ናብ culturally dominate እቲ ግዙፍ ካብ southern ምዑዝ ,Britain እኳ ናይ ቀረባ genetic ማስረጃ suggests Britons እስካብ ሕዚ formed እቲ ግዙፍ ካብ እቲ .በዝሒ ህዝቢ እዚ dominance creating እንታይ እዩ ሕዚ England እና leaving culturally British enclaves ጥራሕ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ሰሜን ካብ እንታይ እዩ ሕዚ ,England አብ ውሽጢ Cornwall እና እንታይ እዩ ሕዚ ፍሉጥ ከም .Wales Ireland ዝነበረ ዝነበረ unaffected ብ እቲ Romans ,ብዘይካ ,significantly ምህላው ዝነበረ ,Christianised traditionally ብ እቲ -,Romano-Briton Saint .Patrick ከም ,Europe ይሓውስ ,Britain descended ናብ ውሽጢ turmoil ምኽታል እቲ ፈረሰ ካብ Roman ,civilisation ሓደ era ፍሉጥ ከም እቲ ፀልማት ,Ages Ireland entered ሓደ golden ዕድመ እና responded ምስ missions (መጀመርታ ናብ ምዑዝ Britain እና ሽዑ ናብ እቲ ),ኣህጉር እቲ founding ካብ monasteries እና .universities እዚ ኔሮም ዳሕራይ joined ብ -Anglo-Saxon missions ካብ ሓደ ተመሳሳሊ .ተፈጥሮ",መዓዝ ግቡር -Anglo-Saxons ብፃሕ አብ ውሽጢ ?England,Ireland,Hiberni,እቲ 5th ዘመን AD,British

"American sociology in the 1940s and 1950s was dominated largely by Talcott Parsons, who argued that aspects of society that promoted structural integration were therefore ""functional"". This structural functionalism approach was questioned in the 1960s, when sociologists came to see this approach as merely a justification for inequalities present in the status quo. In reaction, conflict theory was developed, which was based in part on the philosophies of Karl Marx. Conflict theorists saw society as an arena in which different groups compete for control over resources. Symbolic interactionism also came to be regarded as central to sociological thinking. Erving Goffman saw social interactions as a stage performance, with individuals preparing ""backstage"" and attempting to control their audience through impression management. While these theories are currently prominent in sociological thought, other approaches exist, including feminist theory, post-structuralism, rational choice theory, and postmodernism.",469,"Who argued that aspects of society that promoted structural integration were therefore ""functional""?",the 1960s,Talcott Parsons,1950s,the 1940s and,2,"American sociology አብ ውሽጢ እቲ 1940s እና 1950s ኔሩ dominated largely ብ Talcott ,Parsons መን argued እቲ aspects ካብ ሕብረተሰብ እቲ promoted structural integration ኔሮም ስለዚ ድማ """".functional እዚ structural functionalism ቅረብ ኔሩ questioned አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ,1960s መዓዝ sociologists መጺኡ ናብ ረአ እዚ ቅረብ ከም ጥራሕ ሓደ justification ን inequalities እዋናዊ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ ኩነታት .quo አብ ውሽጢ ,መልሲ ምሃብ ባእሲ ሓሳብ ኔሩ ,ምዕቡል አየናይ ኔሩ መሰረት ዝገበረ አብ ውሽጢ ክፋል አብ ልዕሊ እቲ philosophies ካብ Karl .Marx ባእሲ theorists ሪኤ ሕብረተሰብ ከም ሓደ arena አብ ውሽጢ አየናይ ፍሉይ groups ሙሉእ ን ምቁጽጻር ልዕሊ .ምንጭታት Symbolic interactionism እውን መጺኡ ናብ ኩን regarded ከም central ናብ sociological .thinking Erving Goffman ሪኤ ማሕበራዊ interactions ከም ሓደ መድረኽ ,ብቅዓት ምስ individuals preparing """"backstage እና attempting ናብ ምቁጽጻር ናቶም ተመልካቲ ብውሽጢ ግንዛበ .ምሕደራ እስካብ እዚ theories እዮም አብዚ ሕዚ ጠቃሚ አብ ውሽጢ sociological ,ሓሳብ ካልእ approaches ,ምህላው ይሓውስ feminist ,ሓሳብ -,post-structuralism ርትዓዊ ምርጫ ,ሓሳብ እና .postmodernism","መን argued እቲ aspects ካብ ሕብረተሰብ እቲ promoted structural integration ኔሮም ስለዚ ድማ """"?functional",እቲ 1960s,Talcott Parsons,1950s,እቲ 1940s እና
"The Story of the Kelly Gang, the world's first feature film, was shot in Melbourne in 1906. Melbourne filmmakers continued to produce bushranger films until they were banned by Victorian politicians in 1912 for the perceived promotion of crime, thus contributing to the decline of one of the silent film era's most productive industries. A notable film shot and set in Melbourne during Australia's cinematic lull is On the Beach (1959). The 1970s saw the rise of the Australian New Wave and its Ozploitation offshoot, instigated by Melbourne-based productions Stork and Alvin Purple. Picnic at Hanging Rock and Mad Max, both shot in and around Melbourne, achieved worldwide acclaim. 2004 saw the construction of Melbourne's largest film and television studio complex, Docklands Studios Melbourne, which has hosted many domestic productions, as well as international features. Melbourne is also home to the headquarters of Village Roadshow Pictures, Australia's largest film production company.

"Darwin proposes sexual selection, driven by competition between males for mates, to explain sexually dimorphic features such as lion manes, deer antlers, peacock tails, bird songs, and the bright plumage of some male birds. He analysed sexual selection more fully in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871). Natural selection was expected to work very slowly in forming new species, but given the effectiveness of artificial selection, he could ""see no limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by nature's power of selection"". Using a tree diagram and calculations, he indicates the ""divergence of character"" from original species into new species and genera.

"During April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve vice-chair Janet Yellen discussed these paradoxes: ""Once this massive credit crunch hit, it didn’t take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.""",482,Who discussed the paradoxes of deleveraging?,April 2009,Janet Yellen,more than a year,U.S. Federal Reserve,2,"አብ እዋን ጉንበት ,2009 ..U.S Federal ምቕማጥ -vice-chair Janet Yellen discussed እዚ :paradoxes ""ሓንሳዕ እዚ ዓብዪ ልቓሕ crunch ,በሎ እቲ ነገር didn’t ውሰድ ነዊሕ ቅድሚ ንሕና ኔሮም አብ ውሽጢ ሓደ .recession እቲ ,recession አብ ውሽጢ ,ተጠወ deepened እቲ ልቓሕ crunch ከም ተጠላብነት እና ምቑጻር ስራሕ ,መፍርሒ እና ልቓሕ losses ካብ ፋይናንሳዊ institutions .surged ,ብርግፀኝነት ንሕና ኣለኒ ዝነበረ አብ ውሽጢ እቲ grips ካብ ብግልፂ እዚ adverse ርእይቶ ዓንኬል ን ቡዙሕ ካብ ሓደ .ዓመት ሓደ ከይዲ ካብ ሚዛን ወረቐት deleveraging ኣለዎ ምዝርጋሕ ናብ ከባቢ ኩሉ መኣዝን ካብ እቲ .ቁጠባ Consumers እዮም pulling ዝባን አብ ልዕሊ ,purchases ብፍላይ አብ ልዕሊ durable ,ኣቕሑ ናብ ህነፅ ናቶም .savings Businesses እዮም cancelling planned investments እና laying ምጥፋእ workers ናብ ምዕቃብ .ጥረ ገንዘብ ,እና ፋይናንሳዊ institutions እዮም shrinking ሃብቲ ናብ bolster ሃብቲ እና አማዕብል ናቶም chances ካብ weathering እቲ እዋናዊ .ህቦብላ ሓንሳዕ ,ካልኣይ Minsky ርዱእ እዚ .dynamic ንሱ spoke ካብ እቲ paradox ካብ ,deleveraging አብ ውሽጢ አየናይ precautions እቲ ተዝኸዉን ኩን ንቁሕ ን individuals እና firms—and ብርግፀኝነት ኣገዳሲ ናብ ተመለስ እቲ ቁጠባ ናብ ሓደ ንቡር state—nevertheless magnify እቲ ጭንቀት ካብ እቲ ቁጠባ ከም ሓደ .""ሙሉእ",መን discussed እቲ paradoxes ካብ ?deleveraging,ጉንበት 2009,Janet Yellen,ቡዙሕ ካብ ሓደ ዓመት,..U.S Federal ምቕማጥ

"Insects are the only group of invertebrates to have developed flight. The evolution of insect wings has been a subject of debate. Some entomologists suggest that the wings are from paranotal lobes, or extensions from the insect's exoskeleton called the nota, called the paranotal theory. Other theories are based on a pleural origin. These theories include suggestions that wings originated from modified gills, spiracular flaps or as from an appendage of the epicoxa. The epicoxal theory suggests the insect wings are modified epicoxal exites, a modified appendage at the base of the legs or coxa. In the Carboniferous age, some of the Meganeura dragonflies had as much as a 50 cm (20 in) wide wingspan. The appearance of gigantic insects has been found to be consistent with high atmospheric oxygen. The respiratory system of insects constrains their size, however the high oxygen in the atmosphere allowed larger sizes.

"Research on emotion has increased significantly over the past two decades with many fields contributing including psychology, neuroscience, endocrinology, medicine, history, sociology, and even computer science. The numerous theories that attempt to explain the origin, neurobiology, experience, and function of emotions have only fostered more intense research on this topic. Current areas of research in the concept of emotion include the development of materials that stimulate and elicit emotion. In addition PET scans and fMRI scans help study the affective processes in the brain.
