# SYNTH-L: Synthetic Data Generation for Low-Resource Natural Language Processing
A repository storing the codebase for SYNTH-L.

Acknowledgments: I acknowledge the use of OpenAI’s ChatGPT (Basic version) for occasional assistance in refining the syntactical structure and phrasing of the code. All core algorithmic design, implementation, and conceptual development were performed independently by me; ChatGPT’s role was limited to language polishing and consistency checks.
